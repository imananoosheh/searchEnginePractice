Contents 1 Personal life 2 Aviation camouflage 3 Death 4 References Personal life[edit] Mary Taylor Whelpley was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on January 11, 1866, to James Davenport and Mary Louise (née Breed) Whelpley.[1] Mary Taylor met George de Forest Brush while studying at Art Students League of New York, where he was her teacher.[2] They married in New York City in 1886,[3] on her twentieth birthday, after eloping.[2][4][5] They moved to Quebec, returning to New York after two years.[6] In the late 1890s, Brush's health deteriorated and they briefly relocated to Florence, Italy, for treatment; they would spend some time in the area every year prior to World War I.[6] In either 1890 or 1901 George bought Townsend Farm in Dublin, New Hampshire, where the family had spent vacations before, and they moved there.[5][6] Brush was the main subject of her husband's art from the early 1890s until World War I, as he painted many 'Mother and Child' images of her with their various children.[6] Aviation camouflage[edit] Brush was an early aviator, and also developed camouflage for aircraft. The family were sometime neighbors of Amelia Earhart, to whom Brush was a friend.[4] In camouflage work, the Brushs (including eldest son Gerome, b. 1888) and friend Abbott H. Thayer contributed to World War I plane masking efforts.[4] She designed and patented planes, with parts of one surviving and being exhibited in Eagles Mere Air Museum, Pennsylvania from 2011.[4][7] Brush's 1917 drawing from US patent 1293688 Thayer and the Brushs applied principles of art to engineering in order to develop camouflaging. A 1917 patent filed by Brush claimed that she was "able to produce a machine which is practically invisible when in the air".[7] Mary Taylor had trained as a pilot prior to the outbreak of World War I and first tested her husband's designs, then began experimenting herself, on a Morane-Borel monoplane purchased in 1916.[7] While other artists employed to develop vehicle camouflages for the war used Modernist techniques to alter color perception, the academic artists Thayer and Brushs were said to be inspired by instances of camouflage in nature; different variations on their designs included giving planes light-colored underbellies and using counter-illumination to render the plane as bright as sky and seemingly transparent.[7] Exploring counter-illumination techniques, George used varnished silk to dress the plane, but it was not durable enough; Mary Taylor instead decided to punch holes in parts of the (linen) wings, pairing this with lightbulbs in different parts of the fuselage to scatter light around the plane. She tested the plane herself around Long Island and New Hampshire.[7] The designs were not used in World War I, but were explored and tested again in World War II.[7] Death[edit] Brush died on July 29, 1949, in Dublin, New Hampshire, and was buried in the Dublin Town Cemetery.[8] References[edit] ^ "Brush, Mary "Mittie" Taylor Whelpley (1866-1949)".
