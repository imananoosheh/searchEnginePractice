List of medical wikis - Wikipedia List of medical wikis From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article This is a list of medical wikis, collaboratively-editable websites that focus on medical information. Many of the most popular medical wikis take the form of encyclopedias, with a separate article for each medical term. Some of these websites, such as WikiDoc and Radiopaedia, are editable by anyone, while others, such as Ganfyd, restrict editing access to professionals. The majority of them have content available only in English. The largest and most popular general encyclopedia, Wikipedia, also hosts a significant amount of health and medical information.

WikiDoc[edit] WikiDoc Type of site Wiki Headquarters Boston Owner WikiDoc Foundation Created by C.

WikiDoc was started in December 2005 by C. Michael Gibson, of Harvard Medical School.[17][18] The original content came from Gibson's chief residency notes, board review notes, and content from a variety of copyleft sources including The U.S. National Library of Medicine, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Wikipedia and Ask Dr Wiki.[19] WikiDoc differs from Wikipedia in the following ways:[20] it is oriented more to medical professionals,[21] and has medical news, a toolbar to search internet on the right hand side to gather articles, guidelines and slides, a toolbar on the left to see what page most people looked at next, and a board review course (in Beta testing). WikEM[edit] Main article: WikEM WikEM Type of site Wiki Available in English Headquarters Los Angeles Owner WikEM Foundation Created by Ross Donaldson URL www.wikem.org Alexa rank 297,825 as of Nov 2019[22] Commercial No Registration No Launched 2009 Current status October 2016: 3,176 content pages WikEM is a wiki-based website and point-of-care mobile application for emergency medicine clinicians.[23] WikEM started as a database created from notes and checklists passed from each resident class to the next at the Harbor-UCLA emergency medicine residency program, but is now open to all clinical providers.[24][25] WikEM was launched in its current form in 2009.[24] WikEM's mobile applications are available in both iOS and Android, allowing for quick mobile usage, as well as offline use in austere environments and disaster situations. It calls itself The Global Emergency Medicine Wiki.

Defunct[edit] AskDrWiki[edit] AskDrWiki Type of site Expert medical wiki project Headquarters Cleveland, Ohio Owner Open Access Medical Informatics Group Created by Kenny Civello, Brian Jefferson URL www.askdrwiki.com Alexa rank 3,857,833 as of Nov 2016 Commercial No Registration Required with credentialing Launched August 2006 Current status Website no functional. In November 2013, there were 2,111 pages and 1,408 content pages. In February 2015, there were still the same number of pages. AskDrWiki is a medical wiki encyclopedia created by Cleveland Clinic Cardiology Fellows Kenny Civello and Brian Jefferson. The project was started as a response to the lack of free online medical information found in several community hospitals and was created to form a repository of cardiovascular information that could be readily accessed for reference. It was launched in August 2006. The site now holds medical review articles, clinical notes, pearls, and medical images. The wiki allows anyone with a medical background to contribute or edit medical articles, of which there are over 2,000 as of 2013[update]. The purpose of the site was to provide reliable and easily accessed health information for the medical community including physicians, nurses, and medical students. The information published on the site is not meant to supersede medical training but to serve as a repository of medical review articles to give medical professionals an online source where they can review medical topics. The website is similar to Wikipedia because it runs on MediaWiki software allowing users to add and edit articles, but differs in that all users must be credentialed based on their medical training before they are allowed to publish. Its goal is not to compete with Wikipedia regarding consumer health-related topics, but to serve as an expert medical wiki and provide a source of up-to-date medical information for healthcare providers. In December 2006, AskDrWiki was referenced in a British Medical Journal article, "How Web 2.0 is Changing Medicine",[29] as one of the early adopters of using video hosting sites such as YouTube and Google Video to host medical videos. It was also discussed in a 2007 Nature Medicine article on medical wikis.[30] AskDrWiki has been featured in other media including The Plain Dealer,[31] Medical Economics[32] and The American Medical Association News.[33] As of February 2015, although still online, the wiki had minimal ongoing contributions, with only 3 edits in 2014.[34] Ganfyd[edit] Main article: Ganfyd Ganfyd Type of site Wiki Available in English Revenue nil URL ganfyd.org Alexa rank 1,228,616 as of Nov 2016 Commercial No Registration Required Launched November 2005 Current status October 2019: Defunct Ganfyd is a medical wiki community and encyclopedia,[16] created in November 2005 by a group of doctors working in the United Kingdom. Only registered medical practitioners or persons working under their direction, and a small number of invited non-medical specialists, may edit Ganfyd articles. The intention was to make the material reliable enough for professional medical use. As of 2013[update] it has over 8000 content pages. Medcyclopaedia[edit] The Encyclopaedia of Medical Imaging[35] was a wiki encyclopedia of medical imaging used in radiology and radiography.[36] Its online version is called Medcyclopaedia.[37] As of December 2012, the site no longer exists. The encyclopedia was the result of a collaboration of the Nycomed Amersham Intercontinental Continuing Education in Radiology Institute (NICER Institute), Sweden, Department of Radiology, Lund University, Sweden, and Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway. It was provided and copyrighted by the healthcare unit of General Electric corporation. Retrieval of images (other than thumbnails) required registration. The website contained 3,600 pages. Medpedia[edit] Medpedia Type of site Wiki Available in English Owner Medpedia Inc., Ooga Labs Revenue Lost money URL Medpedia.com Alexa rank 2,211,327 (April 2014[update])[38] Commercial Yes Registration Required Launched 17 February 2009 Current status Closed January 2013 Medpedia was a collaborative project launched on 17 February 2009. Its aim was to create an open access medical wiki encyclopedia[39] in association with Harvard Medical School, Stanford School of Medicine, Berkeley School of Public Health, University of Michigan Medical School, the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS)[40] as well as other contributors.[41] Content was licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) license and ran on modified MediaWiki software. Harvard Medical School did not have a role in, nor was it responsible for, the content that appeared in the “wiki” section of Medpedia. Anyone with medical knowledge was welcome to become part of Medpedia's community. However, to qualify to edit or contribute to the main content, approved editors needed an M.D., D.O., or Ph.D. in a biomedical field. Others could contribute by writing in suggestions for changes to the site using the "Make a suggestion" link at the top of each page. An approved editor could review and potentially add submitted suggestions.[42] Medpedia was composed of three primary components: A collaborative encyclopedia (also referred to as the "knowledge base") A Network & Directory for health professionals and organizations Communities of Interest where medical professionals and non-professionals come together to discuss topics of interest. A 2012 literature review of 50 academic journal articles about the use of social media by clinicians[43] remarked that Medpedia had "launched in 2009 with substantial institutional backing" but that the authors "did not find articles reporting success metrics" for it. Around January 2013 the site abruptly closed. Medpedia's founder James Currier acknowledged that this was permanent in a blog post in July 2013.[44] WikiSurgery[edit] WikiSurgery Type of site Wiki Available in English Owner International Journal of Surgery Commercial No Launched September 2006 Current status November 2013: Not operating WikiSurgery is a collaboratively-built online encyclopedia hosted by the International Journal of Surgery. As of November 2013, the site's homepage is still up but none of the rest of the website is viewable.
