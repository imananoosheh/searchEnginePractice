Wikiwand - Wikipedia Wikiwand From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Viewer interface for Wikipedia Wikiwand Type of business Private, Startup company Available in English Founded 2013 Headquarters San Francisco Bay Area Area served Worldwide Founder(s) Lior Grossman, Ilan Lewin Employees 10+ URL www.wikiwand.com Registration Optional Current status Online Native client(s) on iOS Wikiwand is a proprietary software interface developed for viewing Wikipedia articles[1] available for several popular web browsers as a free browser extension or mobile app. Contents 1 History of Wikiwand 2 Availability 3 Business model 4 References 5 External links History of Wikiwand[edit] Wikiwand (originally WikiWand) was founded in 2013 by Lior Grossman and Ilan Lewin.[2] Officially launched in August 2014,[3] the interface includes a sidebar menu, navigation bar, personalized links to other languages, new typography, and access to previews of linked articles.[4] The list of contents is constantly displayed on the left-hand side.[5] According to Grossman, "It didn’t make sense to us that the fifth most popular website in the world, used by half a billion people, has an interface that hasn’t been updated in over a decade. We found the Wikipedia interface cluttered, hard to read (large blocks of small text), hard to navigate, and lacking in terms of usability."[6] Availability[edit] The interface is available on Chrome, Safari and Firefox as well as via Wikiwand's website. In March 2015, Wikiwand released an iOS app for iPhone and iPad.[7] An Android app is currently under development.[8] Business model[edit] In 2014, Wikiwand was able to raise $600,000 to support the development of the interface. It has stated that it intends to raise revenue through advertising[6] and donate 30% of its profits to the Wikimedia Foundation.[6][9] References[edit] ^ Jillian Wong (21 August 2014).
