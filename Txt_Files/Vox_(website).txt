The tweets drew attention after violent anti-Trump protests took place in San Jose, California on the day of Rensin's tweet.[12][13][14][15] Elizabeth Plank was hired in 2016 as a political correspondent,[16] and in 2017 launched her own series with Vox Media, called Divided States of Women.[17] In September 2017, Klein published a post on vox.com announcing that he was taking on a new role as editor-at-large, and that Lauren Williams, who joined Vox a few months after its founding, was the new editor-in-chief.[18][19] Content According to Vox's founding editors, the site seeks to explain news by providing additional contextual information not usually found in traditional news sources.[20] To reuse work from authors prior to the relaunch in 2014, Vox creates "card stacks" in bright canary yellow that provide context and define terms within an article. The cards are perpetually maintained as a form of "wiki page written by one person with a little attitude".[21] As an example, a card about the term "insurance exchange" may be reused on stories about the Affordable Care Act.[21] Vox uses Vox Media's Chorus content management system, which enables journalists to easily create articles with complex visual effects and transitions, such as photos that change as the reader scrolls.[21] Vox Media's properties target educated households with six-figure incomes and a head of house less than 35 years old.[21] Video Vox has a YouTube channel by the same name where they have regularly posted videos on news and informational subjects since 2014.[22] These videos are accompanied by an article on their website. The themes covered in the videos are usually similar to the themes covered in the regular, written articles on the website.[23] The channel has over 7.11 million subscribers and over 1.7 billion views as of 15 January 2020[update].[22] Content surrounds both current affairs, timeline of certain events, and interesting facts.[24] In May 2018, Vox partnered with Netflix to release a weekly TV show called Explained.[25][26] Podcasts Zack Beauchamp interviewing Michael Bennet for the Worldly podcast in 2019. Vox distributes eight podcasts, all hosted by Vox staff:[27] The Weeds is a twice-weekly roundtable podcast, hosted by Klein, Yglesias, healthcare-policy correspondent Sarah Kliff, immigration correspondent Dara Lind, and senior politics reporter Jane Coaston focusing on U.S. national news with a focus on the fine details of public policy.[27][28][29] The Ezra Klein Show is a twice-weekly interview podcast in which Klein interviews guests in politics and media.[30] I Think You're Interesting is a weekly interview podcast about the arts, entertainment, and pop culture, hosted by Vox's "critic at large" Emily VanDerWerff.[27][31] Worldly is a weekly roundtable podcast focusing on U.S. foreign policy and international affairs, hosted by Vox foreign-and-security-policy writers Jennifer Williams, Zach Beauchamp, and Alex Ward; Yochi Dreazen also previously hosted.[27][32] The Impact is a weekly narrative podcast hosted by Kliff investigating the effects of policy decisions in practice.[33] Today, Explained is a daily podcast, hosted by Sean Ramaswaram, providing short explanations of items in the news.[27][34] Future Perfect is a weekly podcast, hosted by Dylan Matthews, exploring provocative ideas with the potential to radically improve the world, often discussing ideas associated with effective altruism.[35][36][37] Primetime is a short-run podcast hosted by Emily VanDerWerff. Season 1 (six episodes) focused on TV's relationship with the presidency and was released on a weekly schedule.[27][38] Reception In March 2014, before it had officially launched, Vox was criticized by conservative media commentators, including Erick Erickson, for a video[39] it had published arguing the U.S. public debt "isn't a problem right now".[40] The website's launch received significant media attention.[41] Websites noted that the launch came around the same time as other data and explainer websites like FiveThirtyEight and The New York Times' The Upshot.[42][43] Vox was described as using clickbait-style headlines to enhance shareability and to act as a "Wikipedia for ongoing news stories".[41] Shortly after it launched, conservative writer David Harsanyi criticized the site's concept of "explanatory journalism" in an article in The Federalist titled "How Vox makes us stupid", arguing that the website selectively chose facts, and that "explanatory journalism" inherently leaves out opposing viewpoints and different perspectives.[44] Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry at The Week argued that the website produced "partisan commentary in question-and-answer disguise" and criticized the site for having a "starting lineup [that] was mostly made up of ideological liberals".[45] The Week's Ryu Spaeth described the site's operations as: "It essentially takes the news (in other words, what is happening in the world at any given moment in time) and frames it in a way that appeals to its young, liberal audience."[46] The Economist, commenting on Klein's launching essay "How politics makes us stupid",[47] said the website was "bright and promising" and site's premise of "more, better, and more lucidly presented information" was "profoundly honourable", and positively compared the site's mission to John Keats's negative capability.[11] In December 2014, the website Deadspin wrote a post listing each time Vox ran a correction for a factual error in an article.[48] In an opinion piece in The Washington Times, Christopher J. Harper criticized the site for numerous reporting mistakes.[49] The New York Times' David Carr associated Klein's exit for Vox with other "big-name journalists" leaving newspapers for digital start-ups, such as Walter Mossberg and Kara Swisher (of Recode), David Pogue, and Nate Silver.[6] In 2015, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry presented Julia Belluz the Robert B. Balles Prize for Critical Thinking for her work on Vox.[50] Accolades Original programming by Vox has been recognized by the News & Documentary Emmy Awards, which are presented by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2017, the documentary 2016 Olympics: What Rio Doesn't Want the World to See was nominated in the "Outstanding News Special" category, Vox Pop was nominated in the "Outstanding Arts, Culture and Entertainment Report" and "Outstanding Graphic Design and Art Direction" categories,[51] and The Secret Life of Muslims was nominated in the "Outstanding Short Documentary" category.[52] In 2018, Borders was nominated in the "Outstanding Video Journalism: News" category,[53] and Earworm received nominations in the "Outstanding Graphic Design and Art Direction" and "Outstanding New Approaches: Arts, Lifestyle and Culture" categories.[54] Readership Vox received 8.2 million unique visitors in July 2014.[55] In August 2019 readership was estimated to be 33.4 million visitors.[56] In a 2017 interview on Nieman Lab, Klein stated: "We watch our audience data pretty closely, and our audience data does not show or suggest to us that we are overwhelmingly read on one side or the other of the political sphere, which is good...And overall our audience leans a bit left, but it doesn't lean overwhelmingly so."[57] See also Education portal History portal United States portal References ^ "vox.com Traffic Statistics".
