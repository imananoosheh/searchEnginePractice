Due to the scarcity of land available for cultivation, the early inhabitants migrated to adjacent areas where wider lands can be discovered. They found Poblacion, the present site where the Spaniards met the natives of Moron. Our Lady of the Pillar Parish Church Folkloric tradition alludes the etymology of the name Moron comes from the Spaniard's mishearing of the phrase "mga Moro umurong" when they asked they local people the name of their village. The historical accuracy of this etymology is questionable, however, since early Filipinos could not have known or used the term Moro as it were the Spaniards who have started using the term to refer to Filipino Moslems, a spanish term for the moslem Moorish conquerors of 8th century Spain. Most probable etymology comes from the spanish word morón which refers to a hill which can be seen from the sea. Several towns are also named Morón namely Morón in Cuba, Morón de la Fronterra in Sevilla, Spain, Morón in Buenos Aires, Argentina. These place all have hilly topographies and are nearby the ocean. On June 10, 1955, Moron was renamed Morong by Bataan representative Jose R. Nuguid by virtue of Republic Act No. 1249 which was enacted by the Batasan Pambansa. In 1578, it became part of Corrigimento de Mariveles together with Bagac and Maragondon, Cavite. But it was only in 1607 that Moron was officially founded as an ecclesiastical parish and as a pueblo including the Coral Stone Church by the Recollects and was officially founded by Fr. Rodrigo de San Miguel who placed it under the protection of the Our Lady of the Pillar. The Our Lady of the Pillar Parish of Morong, erected in 1607 (one of the oldest seats of Catholic faith in the Philippines) originally orchestrated from the elements of the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque sources. It culminated its 400th Year foundation anniversary on October 12, 2007.[5] In 1578, it became part of Corrigimento de Mariveles together with Bagac and Maragondon, Cavite.

Many residents answered the call to serve. Later after the fall of Bataan up until the Liberation, boonie guerilla groups sought to fight and sabotage the Japanese occupying forces. The Seven Day Battle of Mauban (Morong, Bataan)[edit] See also: Battle of Bataan For the defense of Bataan, the main and first battle position established by the USAFFE was the Mabatang(Abucay)-Mauban(Morong) Line. General Wainwright was in command of the Mauban side of the defense. On 16 January 1942, Imperial Japanese Army and an Allied coalition of Filipino-American forces both raced to capture Morong. They reached the town around the same time, but the Allies had detected the Japanese first. Taking the opportunity for a surprise attack, Lieutenant Edwin P. Ramsey of the 26th Cavalry Regiment ordered his troops to charge; the 27 heavily outnumbered Filipino and American cavalrymen charged and scattered the surprised Japanese. It was the last charge of American cavalry.[7] Geography[edit] According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the municipality has a land area of 219.20 square kilometres (84.63 sq mi)?[2] constituting 15.97% of the 1,372.98-square-kilometre- (530.11 sq mi) total area of Bataan.
