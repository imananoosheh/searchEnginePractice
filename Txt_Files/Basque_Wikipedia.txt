Type of site Internet encyclopedia project Available in Basque Owner Wikimedia Foundation URL eu.wikipedia.org Commercial No Registration Optional Launched December 6, 2001; 18 years ago (2001-12-06) The Basque Wikipedia (Basque: Euskarazko Wikipedia[1] or Euskal Wikipedia) is the Basque language edition of Wikipedia. Founded on December 6, 2001,[2] although its main page was created in November 2003, it reached 58,124 articles by August 19, 2010, making it the 45th-largest Wikipedia.[3] As of March 2020, it has 528 active contributors, of which 12 are administrators, and has about 342,000 articles.[4][5][6] In an August 2007 interview, Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, used the Basque Wikipedia as an example of the rationale for having Wikipedias in smaller languages: "Certainly within Wikipedia right now we are seeing some fairly successful projects in small European languages. You don't really need a Welsh language Wikipedia, perhaps. The number of people who speak Welsh who don't also speak English is very small and getting smaller every year. So why do we have a Welsh Wikipedia? Well, people wanted it, so they're making it. And language preservation is the main motive. It is their mother tongue and they want to keep it alive, keep its literature alive. Certainly some of the larger small languages like Basque and Catalan have very successful projects. I definitely see that preserving parts of your language and culture through collaborative projects makes a lot of sense."[7] On January 25, 2008, the Basque Wikipedia was awarded the Argia Saria granted by the magazine Argia in the category of Internet.[8][9][10] On May 21, 2011, Basque Wikipedia published its 100,000 article, an article about the prohibition of using Basque language throughout history called Euskararen debekua.[11] In December 2011, around 11,000 new articles were added to Basque Wikipedia by the Culture Ministry of the Basque Government.[12] Contents 1 Statistics 1.1 New articles per day 1.2 Topics 2 Gallery 3 References 4 External links Statistics[edit] As of February 2012, the Basque Wikipedia has the second greatest number of articles per speaker among Wikipedias with over 100,000 articles, and ranks sixth overall.[13] These figures were based on Ethnologue's estimate of 665,800 Basque speakers.
