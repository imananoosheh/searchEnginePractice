Reviewing Mrs Beeton in the UK daily newspaper The Independent, Frances Spalding wrote: "There is seemingly no aspect of Victorian life that Kathryn Hughes cannot assimilate and understand from the inside. This is living history, in which massive research and impeccable scholarship is handled with invigorating panache".[7] Hughes has also reviewed and written for The Guardian, The Economist and The Times Literary Supplement.[2] An occasional presenter of Open Book on BBC Radio 4, she also contributes to the same network's Saturday Review.[8][9][10] She is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Literature.[11] Contents 1 Bibliography 1.1 Books 1.2 Critical studies and reviews of Hughes' work 2 References Bibliography[edit] This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
