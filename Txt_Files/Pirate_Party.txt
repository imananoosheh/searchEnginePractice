Falkvinge was inspired to found the party after he found that Swedish politicians were generally unresponsive to Sweden's debate over changes to copyright law in 2005.[2] The United States Pirate Party was founded on 6 June 2006 by University of Georgia graduate student Brent Allison. The party's concerns were abolishing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, reducing the length of copyrights from 95 years after publication or 70 years after the author's death to 14 years, and the expiry of patents that do not result in significant progress after four years, as opposed to 20 years. However, Allison stepped down as leader three days after founding the party.[3] The Pirate Party of Austria (German: Piratenpartei Österreichs) was founded in July 2006 in the run-up to the 2006 Austrian legislative election by Florian Hufsky and Jürgen "Juxi" Leitner.[4] The Pirate Party of Finland was founded in 2008 and entered the official registry of Finnish political parties in 2009. The Pirate Party of the Czech Republic (Czech: ?eská pirátská strana) was founded on 19 April 2009 by Ji?í Kade?ávek. The 2009 European Parliament election took place between the 4 and 7 June 2009, and various Pirate Parties stood candidates. The most success was had in Sweden, where the Pirate Party of Sweden won 7.1% of the vote, and had Christian Engström elected as the first ever Pirate Party Member of European Parliament (MEP).[5][6] Following the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Pirate Party of Sweden were afforded another MEP in 2011, that being Amelia Andersdotter. On 30 July 2009, the Pirate Party UK was registered with the Electoral Commission. Its first party leader was Andrew Robinson, and its treasurer was Eric Priezkalns.[7][8][9] In April 2010, an international organisation to encourage cooperation and unity between Pirate Parties, Pirate Parties International, was founded in Belgium.[10] Ivan Bartoš (left), chairman of the Czech Pirate Party, and Libor Michálek, Czech whistleblower and Pirate Party member, 2012 In the 2011 Berlin state election to the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin, the Pirate Party of Berlin (a state chapter of Pirate Party Germany) won 8.9% of the vote, which corresponded to winning 15 seats.[11][12] John Naughton, writing for The Guardian, argued that the Pirate Party of Berlin's success could not be replicated by the Pirate Party UK, as the UK does not use a proportional representation electoral system.[13] In the 2013 Icelandic parliamentary election, the Icelandic Pirate Party won 5.1% of the vote, returning three Pirate Party Members of Parliament. Those were Birgitta Jónsdóttir for the Southwest Constituency, Helgi Hrafn Gunnarsson for Reykjavik Constituency North and Jón Þór Ólafsson for Reykjavik Constituency South.[14][15] Birgitta had previously been an MP for the Citizens' Movement (from 2009 to 2013), representing Reykjavik Constituency South. As of 2015[update], it was the largest political party in Iceland, with 23.9% of the vote.[16] The 2014 European Parliament election took place between the 22 and 24 May. Julia Reda was at the top of the list for Pirate Party Germany, and was subsequently elected as the party received 1.45% of the vote. Other notable results include the Czech Pirate Party, who received 4.78% of the vote, meaning they were 0.22% off getting elected, the Pirate Party of Luxembourg, who received 4.23% of the vote, and the Pirate Party of Sweden, who received 2.19% of the vote, but lost both their MEPs.[17] Reda had previously worked as an assistant in the office of former Pirate Party MEP Amelia Andersdotter.[18] On 11 June 2014, Reda was elected Vice-President of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament.[19] Reda was given the job of copyright reform rapporteur.[20] The Icelandic Pirate Party was leading the national polls in March 2015, with 23.9%. The Independence Party polled 23.4%, only 0.5% behind the Pirate Party. According to the poll, the Pirate Party would win 16 seats in the Althing.[21][22] In April 2016, in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal, polls showed the Icelandic Pirate Party at 43% and the Independence Party at 21.6%,[23] although the Pirate Party eventually won 15% of the vote in the 29 October 2016 parliamentary election. In April 2017, a group of students at University of California, Berkeley formed a Pirate Party to participate in the Associated Students of the University of California senate elections, winning the only third-party seat.[24] Czech Pirate Party entered the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament for the first time after the election held on 20 and 21 October 2017 with 10.79%. Czech Pirate Party, after finishing at the second place at the 2018 Prague municipal election, held on 5 and 6 October 2018, with 17.1%, formed a coalition with Prague Together and United Forces for Prague (TOP 09, Mayors and Independents, KDU-?SL, Liberal-Environmental Party and SNK European Democrats). The representative of the Czech Pirate Party, Zden?k H?ib, was selected as a Mayor of Prague. It is probably for the first time, when any pirate party has a mayor in one of the major cities of the world. After the 2019 European Parliament election, three newly elected Czech Pirate MEPs and one German Pirate MEP were admitted to the Greens–European Free Alliance, the aforementioned group in the European Parliament that has previously included Swedish Pirate MEPs.

Direct democracy/E-democracy (with the exception of Pirate Party of Greece, which rejected the principle into the 2013 congress) Open access Open data Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing[citation needed] Copyright and censorship[edit] Some campaigns have included demands for the reform of copyright and patent laws.[25] In 2010, Swedish MEP Christian Engström called for supporters of amendments to the Data Retention Directive to withdraw their signatures, citing a misleading campaign.[26] International organizations[edit]   Elected in EU Parliament   Elected nationally   Elected locally   Registered for elections   Registered in some administrative regions   Unregistered but active   Status unknown Pirate Parties International[edit] Main article: Pirate Parties International Pirate Parties International (PPI) is the umbrella organization of the national Pirate Parties. Since 2006, the organization has existed as a loose union[27] of the national parties. Since October 2009, Pirate Parties International has had the status of a non-governmental organization (Feitelijke vereniging) based in Belgium. The organization was officially founded at a conference from 16 to 18 April 2010 in Brussels, when the organization's statutes were adopted by the 22 national pirate parties represented at the event.[28] European Pirate Party[edit] Main article: European Pirate Party The European Pirate Party (PPEU) is a European political party founded in March 2014 which consists of various pirate parties within European countries.[29] Pirates without Borders[edit] Pirates Without Borders is an international association of pirates. Unlike Pirate Parties International (which accepts only parties as voting members and organizations as observing members), Pirates Without Borders accept individuals as members. The PWB see themselves as a basis for international projects. Through global cooperation, they strive to reveal the impact of multinational trade agreements on all people on Earth, and foster freedom and democracy.[30] PWB originates from an independent committee for the coordination of Pirate parties in German-speaking countries, known as DACHLuke (DACHL = Germany-Austria-Switzerland-Luxembourg). Since the Pirate Parties International Conference 2011 on 12 and 13 March 2011, PWB is an "observing member" of Pirate Parties International. The previously independent project "pirate streaming" has become a part of Pirates without Borders since 3 May 2011[citation needed]. Parti Pirate Francophone[edit] In Parti Pirate Francophone, the French-speaking Pirate Parties are organized. Current members are the pirates parties in Belgium, Côte d'Ivoire, France, Canada, and Switzerland.[citation needed] European Parliament elections[edit] 2009[edit] State Date % Seats Sweden 7 June 2009 7.13 2 Germany 7 June 2009 0.9 0 2013[edit] State Date % Seats Croatia* 14 April 2013 1.13 0 *Held in 2013 due to Croatia's entry into EU 2014[edit] State Date % Seats United Kingdom1 22 May 2014 0.49 0 Netherlands 22 May 2014 0.85 0 Austria2 25 May 2014 2.1 0 Croatia 25 May 2014 0.39 0 Czech Republic 25 May 2014 4.78 0 Finland 25 May 2014 0.7 0 France 25 May 2014 0.32 0 Germany 25 May 2014 1.45 1 Greece3 25 May 2014 0.90 0 Estonia4 25 May 2014 1.8 0 Luxembourg 25 May 2014 4.23 0 Poland 25 May 2014 0.02 0 Slovenia 25 May 2014 2.58 0 Spain 25 May 2014 0.24 0 Sweden 25 May 2014 2.23 0 1Party only participated in North West England constituency 2PPAT is in alliance with two other parties: The Austrian Communist Party and Der Wandel.
