It was produced by Finneas, Jack & Coke and A Strut, who also handled the programming. "Bikini Porn" was released without previous announcement as a single on 15 January 2020, on download and streaming services. The single also featured the track "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak", written by Lo and its producer Finneas. "Bikini Porn" is a pop song with a tropical instrumentation. According to the singer, the title of the track means "tan lines" and its lyrics talk about "letting go of your worries". It received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its composition and noted the contrast between the track and "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak". "Bikini Porn" had a minor commercial reception, peaking at number 79 in Sweden and number 35 on the Hot 40 Singles Chart in New Zealand. An accompanying music video for "Bikini Porn", released on 17 January 2020, was directed by Moni Haworth and filmed in Hesperia and Victorville, California. Edited in a lo-fi and VHS style, it depicts the singer wearing different bikinis while dancing in different locations. It also features a cameo by Finneas in the last scene as an Uber driver. "Bikini Porn" was performed live for the first time during the opening show of the Sunshine Kitty Tour in Nashville, Tennessee on 3 February 2020.[1] Contents 1 Background 2 Release 3 Composition 4 Reception 5 Music video 6 Track listing 7 Charts 8 Credits and personnel 9 Release history 10 References 11 External links Background[edit] Finneas, co-writer of "Bikini Porn". According to Tove Lo, she wrote "Bikini Porn" while drinking champagne during a recording session, feeling she was emotionally "in a happy place".[2] She then showed the track to her team, who gave her a lukewarm response towards it. Despite their comments, Lo contacted musician Finneas through mutual friends and sent him the song, asking him to produce it, to which he accepted as he found it "awesome".[3] She stated that Finneas gave the track the "grit and weirdness and bopness" that it needed and was "honored and excited" that he wanted to work with her.[4] As for the collaboration, Finneas revealed on his Instagram account that he became a fan of Lo upon hearing her song "Habits (Stay High)" in 2014, and that "Bikini Porn" was the track he dreamed to produce for her.[5] The duo also wrote the ballad "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak" together, to which Lo recalls telling Finneas, "I love writing with you, you're bringing out this other side of me, I think, a lot of people try to push more of a happier way".[6] According to Tidal, "Bikini Porn" was written by Lo, Finneas, Ludvig Söderberg, Jakob Hazell and Svante Halldin. Its production and programming was handled by Finneas, Jack & Coke and A Strut. On the other hand, "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak" was written solely by Lo alongside Finneas, with the latter also producing, programming and engineering it. Serban Ghenea mixed both tracks with the assistance of John Hannes, while Chris Gehringer mastered them. Finneas also produced the vocals and played the synthesizer and percussion instruments for both songs.[7] Release[edit] In a June 2019 interview with Billboard, Lo stated that she had written songs with Finneas, describing the session as "awesome" and calling him a "really talented" and "amazing" producer and writer.[8] In October of that year, she told NME that, "We're fans of each others' music and he's a really good lyricist so it felt like a fresher, freer session – though I can't say anything about the songs".[9] The next month, Finneas revealed to Radio.com that his collaboration with Lo would be released before April 2020.[10] On 24 December 2019, Lo posted the lyrics of an unreleased song to her Instagram account, using the hashtag "bikiniporn". Cerys Kenneally of The Line of Best Fit concluded the hashtag was the title of the new single.[11] On 15 January 2020, four months after releasing her fourth studio record Sunshine Kitty,[12] Lo released without previous announcement[12] the single "Bikini Porn", which featured the title track and "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak".[13] It became available on both download and streaming services,[14] via Universal Music AB.[15] According to Lo, the reason why both songs were released together was to represent two sides of "the extreme emotions of life".[3] She elaborated that the tracks show that she can be sexual and confident but also smart and poetic at the same time.[16] Some critics noted the difference in composition between "Bikini Porn" and "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak".[17] Stephen Daw of Billboard described them as "almost polar opposites of one another",[18] while Rose Riddell of Coup de Main Magazine wrote both songs "juxtapose each other emotionally and musically".[19] Similarly, Patrick Clarke of NME said that the tracks presented "two different sides to Lo's sound".[20] On the other hand, Mike Wass of Idolator said both songs reflected Finneas' "minimal, alt-leaning sound".[21] Composition[edit] "Bikini Porn" is an uptempo[13] pop song,[14] with a length of two minutes and forty-two seconds.[22] Its instrumentation incorporates a highly processed,[14] tropical beat and backing vocals processed with vocoder.[18] Lo explained on Beats 1 that the title of the track means "tan lines", adding that it reflects about "living in the sun" and the "weird" lifestyle in Los Angeles that she considers to be "so dark and so fun".[2] In another statement, she described "Bikini Porn" as "a sexy and weird song about letting go of your worries" where she also makes fun of herself.[2] Derrick Rossignol of Uproxx opined that Lo was singing about "her success and enjoying a warm day", as demonstrated in the lyrics "All I do is drink champagne all day, all day, all day/ And I dance around my room naked, oh yeah, naked".[23] Writing for MuuMuse, Bradley Stern compared the track's composition to that of Billie Eilish's "Bad Guy" and the songs from Robyn's Body Talk.[2] On the other hand, "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak", is a four-minutes ambient ballad with an instrumentation composed of background noise and percussions.[13][22] It was described by Lo on Beats 1 as a "beautiful, kind of, more poetic ballad".[6] About the title, she told Nylon that she found passion and hate in a passionate relationship to be "really close", where "all of a sudden, [that] turns into more pain than it does love".[3] Stephen Daw said that Lo "laments on a dark period in her relationship" in the lyrics, as exemplified in the verse, "If you break my bones, I'mma hurt my soul, gonna fuck it out again and again".[18] Similarly, Rose Riddell of Coup de Main Magazine said Lo was "reflecting on a dark time in a relationship" in the lyrics of the track.[19] Patrick Clarke of NME noted it had a "darker" thematic than "Bikini Porn".[20] Stern opined "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak" was "more tender" than "Bikini Porn" and noted on it some elements of Eilish's "whisper-soft vulnerability and ominousness" as well as Lo's "emotional turbulence".[2] Rossignol considered it "slower and more somber in tone" than "Bikini Porn", saying its lyrics talked about an "ill-fated relationship".[23] Reception[edit] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said "Bikini Porn" had "earworm melodies and an underlying melancholy" and compared it with Lo's previous singles, "Disco Tits" and "Cool Girl".[2] Madeline Roth of MTV News said the track sounded "like a very, very early contender for song of the Summer",[24] while Patrick Clarke of NME deemed it as "joyous".[20] Similarly, Claire Shaffer of Rolling Stone said "Bikini Porn" was a "hedonist banger" and also a "very early contender for song of the Summer".[25] Jordi Bardají of Jenesaispop called it a "dancey, fun track",[26] while Raúl Guillén of the same website opined the song could have been part of Sunshine Kitty, adding that Finneas' contribution was notorious.[13] An editor of Scandipop said that, with "Bikini Porn", Lo was "at her cheekiest" point.[27] Mike Wass of Idolator found the chorus of the song "quirky" as well as "short and sweet and very, very catchy".[21] Rose Riddel of Coup de Main Magazine called it an "upbeat empowering song",[19] while Jem Aswad of Variety deemed it as a "bouncy" and "driving dancefloor track".[12] Michael Love Michael of Paper opined "Bikini Porn" was a "sexy, empowered track" and a "tongue-in-cheek joke" about Lo herself.[28] Salvatore Maicki of The Fader wrote a positive review of the song, saying it "feels fit for an unseasonably warm January, a tousled paean to living skimpier".[29] In Sweden, "Bikini Porn" debuted at number 76 on the Veckolista Singlar,[30] for the week of 24 January 2020.[31] In New Zealand, "Bikini Porn" debuted at number 35 on the Hot 40 Singles Chart during the week of 27 January 2020.[32] "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak" also received some reviews from critics. Bardají called it "more ambient and emotional" than "Bikini Porn",[26] while Guillén compared it with the songs on Eilish's When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?.[13] The Scandipop website considered the track a "downbeat slice of melancholia",[27] while Wass deemed it as an "experiment".[21] Maicki wrote that "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak" was "the flip side" to "Bikini Porn", adding it is the "woozy comedown from the serotonin rush that preceded it".[29] In a similar review, Shaffer said the song "flips the party into a comedown" and called it a "woozy track that will sound great as a YouTube reverb remix".[25] Deepa Lakshmin of Nylon felt that Finneas' production style was notorious on the song, adding that it was a "quietly powerful" track.[3] Music video[edit] The music video for "Bikini Porn" features Lo wearing bikinis and dancing in different locations, such as the backseat of an Uber car (upper left), a record store (upper right), the back of a trailer (lower left) and a gym (lower right). The music video for "Bikini Porn" was directed by Moni Haworth and filmed in Hesperia and Victorville, California,[33] with a crew of seven people. About the filming, Lo said that it was fun and bizarre to shoot, adding that the clip is sexual and funny while not every scene is "meant to be flattering". Finneas, the track's co-producer and songwriter, makes a cameo as an Uber driver.[34] On 10 January 2020, Lo posted four pictures on Instagram wearing a swimsuit in a desert, with the hashtag #bikiniporn, which led to speculation about a possible upcoming music video by the singer. Twenty-one hours later, the post garnered 81,000 likes and more than 460 comments.[35] On 17 January 2020, Lo released the clip on digital platforms, and wrote a post on Instagram saying, "Anyone shocked it's basically me running around in a bikini? Didn't think so."[33] The music video, which was edited in a lo-fi and VHS style,[26][34] depicts the singer wearing different bikinis while dancing on various locations, such as a desert, a gym and the back of a trailer.[33][34] In one scene, she takes off her top and gets into a pool, paralleling the lyric "Skinny dippin' in the pool with me".[24] Then, she starts dancing in a record shop while being watched by the employees, who eventually kick her out.[24][26][33] In the last scene, she appears dancing in the backseat of an Uber car driven by Finneas, who seems uncomfortable by her presence.[24] About the plot, Lo said "[It's] me in my own world, just living my life without caring what people think."[3] Carolyn Droke of Uproxx opined that the clip "compliments the track's upbeat energy" and that it looked "like a home video".[36] Rolling Stone's Claire Shaffer called it "bizarre",[34] while Jordi Bardají of Jenesaispop noted the singer was "completely unleashed" while showing her sensuality everywhere she went to in the plot.[26] Madeline Roth of MTV News wrote the music video's highlight was the scene with Lo dancing in the backseat of the Uber car with Finneas as a driver.[24] Bradley Stern of MuuMuse considered the plot "fairly straightforward", saying it encapsulated the "blissful absurdity" of the song.[2] Deepa Lakshmin of Nylon felt the clip was a "sharp contrast" to the one for "Glad He's Gone", the lead single from Lo's Sunshine Kitty album, which had a more expensive production. She also complimented Finneas' cameo, saying it was a "fantastic bonus".[3] Track listing[edit] Digital download – "Bikini Porn" single[22] "Bikini Porn" – 2:42 "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak" – 4:00 Charts[edit] Chart (2020) Peak position New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)[32] 35 Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)[31] 76 Credits and personnel[edit] Credits adapted from Tidal.[7] For "Bikini Porn": Lead vocals, background vocals – Tove Lo Songwriting – Tove Lo, Finneas, Ludvig Söderberg, Jakob Hazell, Svante Halldin Production – Finneas, Jack & Coke, A Strut Programming – Finneas, Jack & Coke, A Strut Mixing – Serban Ghenea Mixing assistant – John Hannes Mastering – Chris Gehringer Vocal production – Finneas Synthesizer – Finneas Percussion instruments – Finneas For "Passion and Pain Taste the Same When I'm Weak": Lead vocals, background vocals – Tove Lo Songwriting – Tove Lo, Finneas Production – Finneas Programming – Finneas Audio engineering – Finneas Mixing – Serban Ghenea Mixing assistant – John Hannes Mastering – Chris Gehringer Vocal production – Finneas Synthesizer – Finneas Percussion instruments – Finneas Release history[edit] Region Date Format Label Ref.
