Bamkin had initially coined a name for the project, "Project XX", but that was quickly scuttled in favor of WikiProject Women in Red.[1] After the project was up and running, volunteer editor Emily Temple-Wood signed on. Her specialty is adding a new Wikipedia article about a female scientist each time somebody harasses her about her volunteer editing efforts.[1] At Wikimania 2016, in Esino Lario, Italy, Jimmy Wales, who co-founded Wikipedia in 2001, named Stephenson-Goodknight and Temple-Woods the Wikipedians of the Year, for the prior 12 months, for their effort to fill the gender chasm.[1] Methods[edit] WiR Edit-a-thon at Newnham College in 2017 Button to showcase International Women's Day 2017 WiR edit-a-thons Women in Red conducts Wikipedia edit-a-thons in cities around the world, and continuously hosts a virtual one.[2] The all-day in-person edit-a-thons are focused events conducted to train new contributors so that the Wikipedia gender gap can become narrower and include more content on notable women.[3] Another goal is to increase the number of female editors. Though Wikipedia is "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit", as at 2015 only roughly 10 percent of editors were women.[4][5][6][3] Wikipedia is the fifth most visited web site on the Internet, and the English language Wikipedia contains nearly 5.5 million articles, more than 40 million worldwide on 265 separate language sites, resulting in 16 billion page views per month.[7] The Women in Red participants help to collate 150 worklists of red linked articles to make it easier to find and create the missing articles.[8] As of December 22, 2016[update], Women in Red volunteer editors added over 45,000 articles, and the percentage of tallied articles increased marginally to 16.8 percent of English-language biographies (from 15 percent in July 2015).[9] References[edit] ^ a b c Redden, Molly (March 19, 2016).
