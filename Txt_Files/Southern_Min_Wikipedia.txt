Southern Min Wikipedia Screenshot Type of site Internet encyclopedia project Available in Southern Min Owner Wikimedia Foundation URL zh-min-nan.wikipedia.org Commercial No Registration Optional Launched July 2003 (project established) May 28, 2004; 15 years ago (2004-05-28) (joined Wikipedia) Content license CC-BY-SA 3.0 The Southern Min Wikipedia (Pe?h-?e-j?: Wikipedia Bân-lâm-gú) or Holopedia[1] is the Southern Min edition of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. It is the second largest Wikipedia in a variety of Chinese.[2] Written in Pe?h-?e-j?, it mainly uses the Hokkien Taiwanese dialect. As of November 2016, it has over 200,000 articles.[3] Contents 1 History 2 ISO code 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History[edit] The Southern Min Wikipedia was founded as an independent project known as Holopedia (a reference to H?-ló-o?, a colloquial name for the Southern Min dialect) by Wikipedians Pektiong (Tân Pe?k-tiong) and Kaihsu (Tè Khái-s?) in 2003. A request was then made at the Wikimedia Foundation's Meta-Wiki to create the Wikipedia project for this language. ISO code[edit] At the time of creation there was no ISO 639 code for Southern Min, so the founders decided to use "zh-min-nan", which had been registered as an IETF language tag.[4] Now there is an ISO code for Southern Min (nan) and the domain http://nan.wikipedia.org redirects to http://zh-min-nan.wikipedia.org/. The Southern Min Wikipedia is the only Wikipedia to have two hyphens in the code, although "be-x-old" was formerly used for the Belarusian Wikipedia in classical orthography. In August 2015, the Wikipedians of Southern Min Wikipedia reached a new consensus to officially use "nan" as the language code; however, the consensus hasn't been executed yet.[5][6] See also[edit] Wikipedia in other varieties of Chinese Taiwanese Hokkien Peh-oe-ji References[edit] ^ zh:??????? ^ List of Wikipedias ^ List of Wikipedias on Meta-Wiki. ^ language tag registration form: zh-min-nan ^ "?
