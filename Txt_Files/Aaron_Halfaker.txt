He is known for his research on Wikipedia and the decrease in the number of active editors of the site.[8][9][10] He has said that Wikipedia began a "decline phase" around 2007 and has continued to decline since then.[11][12] Halfaker has also studied automated accounts on Wikipedia, known as bots,[13] and the way they affect new contributors to the site.[4] While a graduate student, he, along with Stuart Geiger, developed a tool for Wikipedia editing called "Snuggle", the goal of which is to eliminate vandalism and spam, and to also highlight constructive contributions by new editors.[14][15] He has also built an artificial intelligence engine known as "Objective Revision Evaluation Service" (or ORES for short), used to identify vandalism on Wikipedia and distinguish it from good faith edits.[16][17] See also[edit] List of Wikipedia people References[edit] ^ Halfaker, Aaron (31 January 2017).
