(August 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A syllabus (/?s?l?b?s/; plural syllabuses[1] or syllabi[2]) or specification is a document that communicates information about a specific course and defines expectations and responsibilities. It is descriptive (unlike the prescriptive or specific curriculum). A syllabus may be set out by an exam board or prepared by the tutor who supervises or controls the course . Etymology[edit] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word syllabus derives from modern Latin syllabus "list", in turn from a misreading of the Greek ???????? sillybos "parchment label, table of contents", which first occurred in a 15th-century print of Cicero's letters to Atticus.[1][3] Earlier Latin dictionaries such as Lewis and Short contain the word syllabus,[4] relating it to the non-existent Greek word ????????, which appears to be a mistaken reading of syllaba "syllable"; the newer Oxford Latin Dictionary does not contain this word.[5][self-published source?] The apparent change from sitty- to sylla- is explained as a hypercorrection by analogy to ?????????? (syllambano "bring together, gather").[5] See also[edit] Look up syllabus in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Lesson plan Education portal References[edit] ^ a b "syllabus".
