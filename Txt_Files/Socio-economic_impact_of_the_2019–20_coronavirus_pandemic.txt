As the pandemic has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector.[1] Supply shortages are expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying, increased usage of goods to fight the pandemic, and disruption to factories and logistics in mainland China. There have been widespread reports of supply shortages of pharmaceuticals,[2] with many areas seeing panic buying and consequent shortages of food and other essential grocery items.[3][4][5] The technology industry, in particular, has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods.[6] On 25 February, it was expected that Australia, mainland China, and Hong Kong would have the most direct economic impacts from the disruption,[7] with Hong Kong already in a recession at that time after a long period of ongoing protests since 2019[8] and Australia widely expected to be in a recession with GDP contracting by 0.2% to 0.5% for 2020,[9] but Morgan Stanley expects the economy of China to grow by between 5.6% (worst-case scenario) to 5.9% for 2020.[10] As mainland China is a major economy and a manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen to pose a major destabilising threat to the global economy.[needs update] Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit forecast in January that markets would remain volatile until a clearer image emerged on potential outcomes. Some analysts estimated as early as January that the economic fallout of the epidemic on global growth could surpass that of the SARS outbreak.[11] Dr. Panos Kouvelis, director of "The Boeing Center" at Washington University in St. Louis, estimates a $300+ billion impact on world's supply chain that could last up to two years.[12] The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reportedly "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China.[13] Global stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.[14][15] By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis.[16][17][18] Global stock markets crashed in March 2020, with falls of several percent in the world's major indices. As the pandemic spreads, global conferences and events across technology, fashion, and sports are being cancelled or postponed.[19] While the monetary impact on the travel and trade industry is yet to be estimated, it is likely to be in the billions and increasing. By 16 March, news reports emerged indicating that the effect on the United States economy will be worse than previously thought.[20] Contents 1 Background 2 Political impacts 2.1 Impact on sovereignty 3 Educational impact 4 Religious impact 5 Economic impact 5.1 Financial impact 5.2 Labor market impact 5.3 Impact by market sectors 5.3.1 Entertainment 5.3.1.1 Cinema 5.3.2 Sports 5.3.3 Television 5.3.4 Video games 5.4 Retail sector 5.5 Restaurant sector 5.6 Science and technology 5.7 Tourism 5.7.1 Events and institutions impacts 5.8 Transportation 5.8.1 Aviation 6 Possible long-term impacts 7 Socio-economic impact by region and country 7.1 East Asia 7.1.1 Mainland China 7.1.1.1 Face mask shortage 7.1.1.2 Economy 7.1.2 Hong Kong 7.1.3 Macau 7.1.4 Japan 7.1.5 South Korea 7.1.6 Taiwan 7.2 Other parts of Asia 7.2.1 South Asia 7.2.1.1 India 7.2.1.2 Sri Lanka 7.2.2 Southeast Asia 7.2.3 West Asia 7.2.3.1 Iran 7.2.3.2 Saudi Arabia 7.3 Europe 7.3.1 Germany 7.3.2 Italy 7.3.3 Portugal 7.3.4 United Kingdom 7.4 North America 7.4.1 Canada 7.4.2 United States 7.5 South America 7.5.1 Argentina 7.5.2 Brazil 7.6 Oceania 7.6.1 Australia 8 See also 9 References Background Movement of WTI price from 2019, with Black Monday of 2020 changes highlighted in red. The pandemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday. A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.[21][22] Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.[23] In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.[24][25] These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.[25] Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.[26][27] The demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold, according to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom. This demand has led to the increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months.[28][29] Political impacts Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on politics A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions. Some experts believe this is likely in a move to protect Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from people's anger over the coronavirus pandemic.[30] Some commentators have suggested that outcry over the disease could be a rare protest against the CPC.[31] Additionally, protests in the special administrative region of Hong Kong have strengthened due to fears of immigration from mainland China.[32] Taiwan has also voiced concern over being included in any travel ban involving the People's Republic of China (PRC) due to the "one-China policy" and its disputed political status.[33][33] Further afield, the treasurer of Australia was unable to keep a pledge to maintain a fiscal surplus due to the effect of the coronavirus on the economy.[34] A number of countries have been using the outbreak to show their support to China, such as when Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia made a special visit to China with an aim to showcase Cambodia's support to China in fighting the outbreak of the epidemic.[35] The United States president Donald Trump was criticised for his response to the pandemic.[36][37][38] He was accused of making several misleading or false claims, of failing to provide adequate information, and of downplaying the pandemic's significance.[39] Trump was also criticised for having closed down the global health security unit of the United States National Security Council, which was founded to prepare the government for potential pandemics.[40] The situation may have a negative impact on his chances of re-election in the 2020 United States presidential election.[41] The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has been heavily affected by the virus, with at least two dozen members (approximately 10%) of the Iranian legislature being infected, as well as at least 15 other current or former top government officials, including the vice-president.[42][43] Advisers to Ali Khamenei and Mohammad Javad Zarif have died from the disease.[44] The spread of the virus has raised questions about the future survival of the regime.[45] Impact on sovereignty Geoeconomics and country risk experts have insisted on the potential erosion of political and economic sovereignty that may affect some already enfeebled countries like Italy: Edward Luttwak has called it "the virus of truth” (interview with La7 TV aired on March 10 2020). M. Nicolas Firzli, director of the World Pensions Council (WPC) and advisory board member at the World Bank Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF), refers to it as “the Greater Financial Crisis”, that will “bring to the surface pent-up financial and geopolitical dysfunctions … [many] national economies will suffer as a result, and their political sovereignty itself may be severely eroded.” [46] Educational impact Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on education The pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closures of schools and universities. As of 16 March 2020, governments in 73 countries have announced or implemented school closures, including 56 countries which closed schools nationwide and 17 countries with localised school closures. Country-wide school closures have affected over 421 million learners globally while localised school closures has put over 577 million learners potentially at risk. According to data released by UNESCO on 10 March, school and university closures due to COVID-19 have left one in five students out of school globally. Religious impact A church forced to closed because of the coronavirus Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on religion The pandemic has impacted religion in various ways, including the cancellation of the worship services of various faiths, the closure of Sunday Schools, as well as the cancellation of pilgrimages surrounding observances and festivals.[47] Many churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples have offered worship through livestream amidst the pandemic.[48] Relief wings of religious organisations have dispatched disinfection supplies, powered air purifying respirators, face shields, gloves, coronavirus nucleic acid detection reagents, ventilators, patient monitors, syringe pumps, infusion pumps, and food to affected areas.[49] Adherents of many religions have gathered together to pray for an end to the pandemic, for those affected by it, as well as for the God they believe in to give physicians and scientists the wisdom to combat the disease;[50][51][52] in the United States, Trump designated 15 March 2020 as a National Day of Prayer for "God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation".[53][54] Economic impact Main article: Coronavirus recession Coronavirus recession refers to an economic recession which may happen across the world economy in 2020 due to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[55][56][57][58] Some economists suggest that China's economy may contract for the first time since the 1970s. Caixin's purchasing managers index for the services sector of China's economy fell to 26.5 in February 2020, the lowest figure recorded since the survey's advent in 2005.[59] As the coronavirus spreads around the world, the stock markets have experienced their worst crash since 1987.[citation needed] Many countries with large economies, such as Italy and Spain, have enacted quarantine policies. This has led to the disruption of business activities in many economic sectors.[citation needed] Financial impact Main articles: Financial impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and 2020 stock market crash See also: 2020 stock market crash and 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war Economic turmoil associated with the coronavirus pandemic has wide-ranging and severe impacts upon financial markets, including stock, bond, and commodity (including crude oil and gold) markets. Major events included the Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war that resulted in a collapse of crude oil prices and a stock market crash in March 2020. Labor market impact China's coronavirus pandemic resulted in the increase in the number of urban unemployed people by 5 million between January and February 2020.[60] In the week ending 21 March, there were 3.3 million jobless claims in the US, compared to 282 thousand the previous week.[61] Impact by market sectors Entertainment Cinema Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on cinema The pandemic has impacted the film industry. Across the world and to varying degrees, cinemas have been closed, festivals have been cancelled or postponed, and film releases have been moved to future dates. As cinemas closed, the global box office dropped by billions of dollars, while streaming became more popular and the stock of Netflix rose; the stock of film exhibitors dropped dramatically. Almost all blockbusters to be released after the March opening weekend were postponed or cancelled around the world, with film productions also halted. Massive losses in the industry have been predicted. Sports Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on sports Several major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including: 2019–20 Chinese Basketball Association season (suspended)[62] 2020 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships (cancelled)[63] 2020 Arctic Winter Games (cancelled)[64] Formula One Australian Grand Prix 2020 (cancelled)[65] with the Bahrain, Chinese ,Vietnam Grands Prix and Azerbaijan postponed.[66][67][68] UEFA Euro 2020 The 2020 edition postponed to 2021[69] 2021 Copa América The 2020 edition postponed to 2021[70] 2019–20 UEFA Champions League (suspended)[71] 2019–20 UEFA Europa League (suspended)[71] All NCAA collegiate athletic competitions for the remainder of the 2019–2020 academic year including the 2020 College World Series and the 2020 Men's and Women's Division I basketball tournaments (all cancelled)[72] 2019–20 NBA season (suspended)[73] 2019–20 NHL season (suspended)[74] 2020 Major League Baseball season (suspended)[75] 2019–20 Premier League (suspended, including lower divisions)[76] 2019–20 Bundesliga (suspended, including lower divisions)[77][78][79][80] 2019–20 Serie A (suspended, including lower divisions)[78] 2019–20 Ligue 1 (suspended indefinitely)[78] 2019–20 La Liga (suspended, including lower divisions)[81] 2020 Major League Soccer season (suspended until 10 May)[82] 2020 Major League Rugby season (cancelled)[83] 2019–20 DEL season (cancelled)[84] 2020 XFL season (cancelled)[85] WrestleMania 36 was moved from Raymond James Stadium to take place behind closed doors at the WWE Performance Center.[86] The 2020 edition of the Grand National has now been cancelled.[87] Before most football divisions across Europe were either cancelled or postponed on 12–13 March 2020, matches in different countries such as Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain and Switzerland were either cancelled, postponed or played behind closed doors.[88] As of 13 March 2020[update], UEFA also considered to suspend the UEFA Euro 2020 and UEFA Women's Euro 2021 as many European football divisions could not be finished in time for the tournaments.[89] Japanese officials suggested that the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo might have to be delayed by up to two years, although the IOC insisted that preparations for the games would continue as planned.[90] Television Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on television The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic has shut down or delayed production of television programs in several countries. Video games Main article: Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the video game industry The pandemic also affected the video game sector to a smaller degree. As the outbreak appeared in China first, supply chains affected the manufacturing and production of some video game consoles, delaying their releases and making current supplies scarcer. As the outbreak and pandemic spread, several keystone trade events, including E3 2020, were cancelled over concerns of further spread. The economic impact on the video game sector is not expected to be as large as in film or other entertainment sectors as much of the work in video game production can be decentralised and performed remotely, and products distributed digitally to consumers regardless of various national and regional lockdowns on businesses and services.[91] Retail sector Best Buy was only letting a limited number of people into their Union Square store in New York City, 18 March 2020 The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic has impacted the retail sector. Retail stores across the world have seen product demand exceeding supply for many consumables, resulting in empty retail shelves.[92][93] In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigou shoppers to re-sell into the China market. "The virus crisis, while frightening, has a silver lining".[94][95] Some retailers are looking at contactless home delivery.[96] Shopping centers around the world responded by reducing hours or closing down temporarily in response. As of 18 March 2020, the footfall to shopping centers fell by up-to 30%, with significant impact in every continent.[97] Simon Property Group became the first major US-based mall operator to close all centers on 18 March, with government mandated closures in UAE, Italy, Germany, Spain, Brazil and Austria as of 23 March. Restaurant sector Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on the restaurant industry The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic has impacted the restaurant business. In the beginning of March 2020, some major cities in the US announced that bars and restaurants would be closed to sit-down diners and limited to takeout orders and delivery.[98] Some employees were fired, and more employees lacked sick leave in the sector compared to similar sectors.[99][100] With only carry-out and delivery services, most servers and bartenders were laid off, prompting these employees creating "virtual tip jars" across 23 U.S. cities.[101] Science and technology Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on science and technology The pandemic has impacted productivity of science, space and technology projects, and to the world's leading space agencies - including NASA and the European Space Agency having to halt production of the Space Launch System, James Webb Space Telescope, and put space science probes into hibernation or low power mode. Most of both agencies' field centers have directed most personnel to telework.[102][103][104][105] Tourism Events and institutions impacts Main articles: List of major affected events and List of closed public venues and institutions The pandemic has caused major events around the world to be cancelled or postponed and public venues and institutions to be closed. Transportation Aviation Main article: Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on aviation A nearly empty flight from Beijing to Los Angeles during the pandemic The pandemic has had a significant impact on aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as slump in demand among travellers. Significant reductions in passenger numbers has resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights. Possible long-term impacts The possibility has been raised that the pandemic could cause a "revolution in working from home", as major companies have implemented expanded telecommuting arrangements for their employees in order to prevent the virus from spreading.[106] There could also be a negative impact on business travel and international conferencing and the rise of their virtual equivalents.[107] There have also been claims that globalisation could be jeopardised by a prolonged global health crisis, as supply chains have been disrupted and reliance on the Chinese economy questioned.[108] Also, restrictions on immigration and increased border enforcement may be seen as justified.[109] The pandemic may have mixed effects on the fight against climate change. Reductions in industrial and transportation activity should reduce emissions in the short-term, while the cheaper oil prices will make it harder for the dirtiest oil to compete.[110] However, emissions are expected to rebound following a possible recession.[110] As resources are diverted from climate action, the world's clean energy transition may be slowed down.[111] On 24 March 2020, German financial analyst Walter Kohl warned that, besides the medical and economic crises that followed from the pandemic, it was likely to also lead to a currency crisis in the Euro zone. Italy and Spain, the two EU countries most affected by the disease, still have not fully recovered from the European debt crisis of 2014, and might need support to avoid national bankruptcy.[112] Socio-economic impact by region and country This section needs to be updated. In particular: Most of this section does not reflect the developments since February 2020. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2020) East Asia Mainland China Main article: 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China The economy of China was anticipated to generate billions in economic output. Morgan Stanley expected the economy of China to grow by between 5.6% (worst-case scenario) to 5.9% for 2020.[10] For reference, China generated US$143 billion in February 2019, the month of Chinese New Year.[113] The Chinese Ministry of Transport reported that trips on trains dropped 73% to 190 million trips from the previous year. Factories, retailers, and restaurant chains closed.[114] All 70,000 theatre screens in the country were shuttered, wiping out the entire box office. This is drastically in stark difference from the week of Chinese New Year in 2019 that generated $836 million.[115] Though cautioning that the economic impact would be short-term, PRC National Development and Reform Commission party secretary Cong Liang views small and medium businesses encountering more difficulties in their operations. Human Resources and Social Security Assistant Minister You Jun specified that agricultural workers and college graduates would have difficulties.[116] Play media Animated map showing confirmed 2019-nCoV cases spreading from 22 January (high resolution) Tourism in China has been hit hard by travel restrictions and fears of contagion, including a ban on both domestic and international tour groups.[117] Many airlines have either cancelled or greatly reduced flights to China and several travel advisories now warn against travel to China. Many countries, including France, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, have evacuated their nationals from the Wuhan and Hubei provinces.[118] The majority of schools and universities have extended their annual holidays to mid-February.[119] Overseas students enrolled at Chinese universities have been returning home over fears of being infected—the first cases to be reported by Nepal and Kerala, a southern state of India, were both of students who had returned home.[120][120][121] Nearly 200 million students have been affected by the in-school closures, with the second semester after the Chunyun resuming on 17 February through online classes for students to follow from their homes instead. The Ministry of Education has introduced a 7,000-server supported "national Internet cloud classroom" to cater to the 50 million elementary and middle school student populations.[122] The Finance Ministry of China announced it would fully subsidise personal medical costs incurred by patients.[123] CNN reported that some people from Wuhan "have become outcasts in their own country, shunned by hotels, neighbors and – in some areas – placed under controversial quarantine measures."[124] The sale of new cars in China has been affected due to the outbreak. There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020.[125] On 24 February, China's Standing Committee declared an immediate and "comprehensive" ban on its US$74 billion wildlife trade industry, citing the "prominent problem of excessive consumption of wild animals, and the huge hidden dangers to public health and safety" that has been revealed by the outbreak. This permanently extends the temporary ban already in place since the end of January.[126][127] According to Carbon Brief, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in China's greenhouse gas emissions being reduced by 25%.[128] In March 2020, satellite images from space provided by NASA revealed that pollution has dropped significantly, which has been attributed in part to the slowdown of economic activity as a result of the outbreak.[129] Face mask shortage People in Wuhan lining up in front of a drug store to buy surgical masks A notice at a supermarket in Beijing, which says each person can only buy one pack of surgical masks and one bottle of 84 disinfectant liquid a day As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public.[130] It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour.[131] Some stores are hoarding, driving up prices and other acts, so the market regulator said it will crack down on such acts.[132][133] The shortage will not be relieved until late February when most workers return from the New Year vacation according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.[134] On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group, said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. Special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's "urgent drug delivery" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival.[135] JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform, said, "We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on" and "while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com has also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly."[136] Other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.[137][138] Economy China's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1% in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new coronavirus pandemic, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters.[139] But on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and that the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged.[140] Due to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the closing time for the Spring Festival will be extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February.[141][142] Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of a shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3%, and the Shanghai Composite Index fell below 3000.[143] On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%.[144] By the end of the day, the decline narrowed slightly to about 7%, the Shenzhen index fell below 10,000 points, a total of 3,177 stocks in the two markets fell.[145] The People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange have announced that the inter-bank Renminbi foreign exchange market, the foreign currency-to-market and the foreign currency market will extend their holiday closed until 2 February 2020.[146] When the market opened on 3 February, the Renminbi was now depreciating against major foreign currencies. The central parity rate of the Renminbi against the US dollar opened at 6.9249, a drop of 373 basis points from the previous trading day.[147] It fell below the 7.00 than an hour after the opening,[148] and closed at 7.0257.[149] Hong Kong Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Hong Kong Hong Kong has seen high-profile protests that saw tourist arrivals from mainland China plummet over an eight-month period. The viral epidemic put additional pressure on the travel sector to withstand a prolonged period of downturn.[150] A drop in arrivals from third countries more resilient during the previous months has also been cited as a concern.[118] The city is already in recession[150] and Moody has lowered the city's credit rating.[151][152] The worst economic effects from the outbreak are expected for Australia, Hong Kong and China.[153] There has also been a renewed increase in protest activity as hostile sentiment against mainland Chinese strengthened over fears of viral transmission from mainland China, with many calling for the border ports to be closed and for all mainland Chinese travellers to be refused entry. Incidents have included a number of petrol bombs being thrown at police stations,[154] a homemade bomb exploding in a toilet,[155] and foreign objects being thrown onto transit rail tracks between Hong Kong and the mainland Chinese border.[156] Political issues raised have included concerns that mainland Chinese may prefer to travel to Hong Kong to seek free medical help (which has since been addressed by the Hong Kong government).[157][158] Since the outbreak of the virus, a significant number of products have been sold out across the city, including face masks and disinfectant products (such as alcohol and bleach).[159] An ongoing period of panic buying has also caused many stores to be cleared of non-medical products such as bottled water, vegetables and rice.[160] The Government of Hong Kong had its imports of face masks cancelled as global face mask stockpiles decline.[161] In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the Education Bureau closed all kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools and special schools until 17 February.[162] This was later extended to 1 March due to further development of the epidemic.[163] The disruption has raised concerns over the situation of students who are due to take examinations at the end of the year, especially in light of the protest-related disruption that happened in 2019.[164] On 5 February, flag carrier Cathay Pacific requested its 27,000 employees to voluntarily take three weeks of unpaid leave by the end of June. The airline had previously reduced flights to mainland China by 90% and to overall flights by 30%.[165] Macau Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Macau On 4 February 2020, all casinos in Macau were ordered shut down for 15 days.[166][167] All casinos reopened on 20 February 2020,[168] but visitor numbers remained low due to the pandemic, with hotels at less than 12% occupancy at the end of February.[169] Japan Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Japan Shelves in a pharmacy in Japan sold out of masks on 3 February 2020 Prime Minister Shinz? Abe has said that "the new coronavirus is having a major impact on tourism, the economy and our society as a whole".[170][171] Face masks have sold out across the nation and stocks of face masks are depleted within a day of new arrivals.[172] There has been pressure placed on the healthcare system as demands for medical checkups increase.[173] Chinese people have reported increasing discrimination.[174] The health minister has pointed out that the situation has not reached a point where mass gatherings must be called off 1 February 2020.[175] Aviation, retail and tourism sectors have reported decreased sales and some manufactures have complained about disruption to Chinese factories, logistics and supply chains.[176] Prime Minister Abe has considered using emergency funds to mitigate the outbreak's impact on tourism, of which Chinese nationals account for 40%.[177] S&P Global noted that the worst hit shares were from companies spanning travel, cosmetics and retail sectors which are most exposed to Chinese tourism.[178] Nintendo announced that they would delay shipment of the Nintendo Switch, which is manufactured in China, to Japan.[179] The outbreak itself has been a concern for the 2020 Summer Olympics which is scheduled to take place in Tokyo starting at the end of July.
