It's very natural for China to make its own products."[6] When searching with the search engine Baidu, the link of the corresponding entry in Baidu Baike, if exists, will be put as the first result or one of the first results.[7] Formation[edit] Front page[edit] The current front page of Baidu Baike was put into use on 6 September 2012. At the top of the page the slogan "Let all humanity learn the world equally," as well as current information on the number of users and entries. On the bottom-left of the front page selected contents are presented; the bottom right contains announcements, plans and projects, etc. The front page information usually includes current hot topics, often related to featured news. Beside those hot topics, there are also one-sentence summaries of the news. Other than the front page, Baidu Baike also includes channels such as nature, culture, geography, and special topics such as core-users, digital museums, etc.[citation needed] Registration[edit] All editors need to register an account before editing, and administrators filter all but the simplest edits before they go public.[8] A phone number registered in mainland China is needed to register a new account.[citation needed] Entries[edit] The entry pages of Baidu Baike include calling cards, texts, and other supporting information. An earlier version allowed users to comment on pages, but this feature was removed after September 2008.[9] The main language used is Chinese, written using the Simplified script; posts written in Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, or Japanese are automatically translated.[citation needed] Calling cards and texts[edit] Baike calling cards contain two parts - the description of an entry and the basic information. The former is similar to the preface of an article, which provides a general introduction to the whole text; the latter uses a table to summarize basic information and statistics. Both are edited separately from the main body of the article. The main texts are limited to 40,000 bits, which is equivalent to 20,000 Chinese characters. At the end of the article is the declaration of exemption. The earlier version of the entry can only contain one image, but now 20 images and 20 albums can be included in an article. The entry can also link to a Baidu map, dynamic screenshots, and videos. Information cited is listed beneath the main text, which does not distinguish footnotes from other details. However, the images cited do not specify the source, but contain image directories.[10][11][citation needed] Supporting information[edit] Most pieces of supporting information are located at the bottom or the right of the page, except scientific terms, which are pushed to the top. Usually, supporting information is automatically generated by the system, with some edited by hand. Supporting information on the right of the page contains personal information, statistics, today in history, contribution of honor, current trends, and pop-links. Statistics include the number of page views, the number of editors, latest updates, creators information, etc. Editors who contribute complex articles are also mentioned and honoured.[12][need quotation to verify] A user can see a database, the Baidu Dictionary, and related entries at the bottom of each article. Celebrities' articles have appended databases that list their single songs, albums, and videos. The user recommendations section is used to collect feedback about the article.[citation needed] Encyclopaedia titles[edit] When an editor's edit is approved, the editor's account receives 'experience points' based on the complexity of the change, (from one to five in order of complexity). Similarly, when an editor successfully completes a requested task, they receive 'experience points' as well as a predetermined number of 'wealth points', which can be used to make purchases on Baidu.[citation needed] Editors are divided into 15 levels with corresponding 'Encyclopaedia titles' (????) based on their accumulated experience points. In 2012, the names of the titles were changed from modern corporate sounding titles to titles reminiscent of the Chinese Imperial examination and Confucian scholarship.[13][better source needed] Scope[edit] Contents and categories[edit] The information on Baidu Baike is broader compared to traditional encyclopedias, similar to Hudong.com. Unlike Wikipedia, Baidu Baike generally do not require notability for the inclusion of an entry. Baidu Baike also includes food recipes, commercial products, internet programs, and literature reviews, as well as articles on diction and common phrases. In addition to articles, Baidu Baike includes several special pages: A Sandbox (????) entry, which gives users a chance to practice editing. Help, which provides terminologies, basic settings, regulations, user titles, etc. User page, which is called "Baidu Authorized ID", and is similar to the one on Wikipedia. However, these are viewed as an encouragement for advanced users, and rarely does anyone have the privilege to make their own page.[14] Baidu Baike holds open policies on the addition of entries, and support categorized search functions. The categorization is based on the characteristics of an entry but not the quality,[15] and there is no limit to categorization. Baidu Baike now has an elementary categorized page and tree. Part of the open categorization can be set according to levels, but catalogs having similar meaning can not be merged or redirected. Numbers of entries[edit] According to the latest list of entries, Baidu Baike has an increase of about 3,800 entries per day. Here are some milestones: Time # Milestone Reference 16 Jan 2008 1M ???

All editors need to register accounts using their real names before editing, and administrators filter edits before they go public.[8] Users on microblogging platforms generally perceive Baidu Baike as similar to a governmentally sanctioned information source due to the censorship of its content.[23] PCWorld states that complying with Chinese censorship laws gives Baidu Baike an advantage over its competitors. Since the Chinese version of Wikipedia does not censor its own content, the government may block it while keeping Baidu Baike accessible.[8] Copyright[edit] Baidu Baike's copyright policy is outlined in the "Terms of Use" section of its help page. It states that by adding content to the site, users agree to assign Baidu rights to their original contributions. It also states that users cannot violate intellectual property law, and that contributions which quote works held under the Creative Commons and/or GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) must follow the restrictions of those licenses.[24] See also[edit] China portal Internet portal Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures Chinese encyclopedias List of online encyclopedias References[edit] ^ a b c Zhang, Jane (20 November 2020).
