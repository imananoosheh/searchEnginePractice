Some major print publications includes Times of India, Economic Times and Navbharat Times.[2] Times Internet ventured into multiple new categories with mixed success. It entered social networking and e-commerce with Indiatimes but was unable to scale the business.[3] The company achieved success with MagicBricks, an online real estate platform launched in 2006 and iDiva, a women's lifestyle portal in 2009.[4][5] 2012 - 2017: Early investments[edit] Times Internet gradually transformed from a media-led company to a technology-led company. It became a conglomerate of multiple digital products, each operating independently within the group. Times Internet made a series of acquisitions - buying majority stakes in MensXP in 2012,[6] Cricbuzz, Coupondunia and Dineout in 2014,[7][8][9] Taskbucks in 2015,[10] 'The Viral Shots’ and WillowTV in 2016.

Through this platform, it was able to move & monetize users across its various digital properties, based on consumer interests & needs.[16] 2017 - 2019: Continued investments[edit] Times Internet continued to acquire and launch multiple new digital products across the consumer technology space.
