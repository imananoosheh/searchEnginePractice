It is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is released under the Apache Software License. Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including Object Pascal, Perl, C#, C++, Python, Ruby and PHP.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Features and common use 3 Lucene-based projects 4 See also 5 References 6 Bibliography 7 External links History[edit] Doug Cutting originally wrote Lucene in 1999.[3] Lucene was his fifth search engine, having previously written two while at Xerox PARC, one at Apple, and a fourth at Excite.[4] It was initially available for download from its home at the SourceForge web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundation's Jakarta family of open-source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top-level Apache project in February 2005. The name Lucene is Doug Cutting's wife's middle name and her maternal grandmother's first name.[5] Lucene formerly included a number of sub-projects, such as Lucene.NET, Mahout, Tika and Nutch. These three are now independent top-level projects. In March 2010, the Apache Solr search server joined as a Lucene sub-project, merging the developer communities. Version 4.0 was released on October 12, 2012.[6] Features and common use[edit] While suitable for any application that requires full text indexing and searching capability, Lucene is recognized for its utility in the implementation of Internet search engines and local, single-site searching.[7][8] Lucene includes a feature to perform a fuzzy search based on edit distance.[9] Lucene has also been used to implement recommendation systems.[10] For example, Lucene's 'MoreLikeThis' Class can generate recommendations for similar documents. In a comparison of the term vector-based similarity approach of 'MoreLikeThis' with citation-based document similarity measures, such as co-citation and co-citation proximity analysis, Lucene's approach excelled at recommending documents with very similar structural characteristics and more narrow relatedness.[11] In contrast, citation-based document similarity measures tended to be more suitable for recommending more broadly related documents,[11] meaning citation-based approaches may be more suitable for generating serendipitous recommendations, as long as documents to be recommended contain in-text citations. Lucene-based projects[edit] Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain crawling and HTML parsing functionality. However, several projects extend Lucene's capability: Apache Nutch – provides web crawling and HTML parsing[citation needed] Apache Solr – an enterprise search server Compass – the predecessor to Elasticsearch[12] CrateDB – open source, distributed SQL database built on Lucene[13] DocFetcher – a multiplatform desktop search application[citation needed] Elasticsearch – an enterprise search server released in 2010[14] Kinosearch – a search engine written in Perl and C[15] and a loose port of Lucene.[16] The Socialtext wiki software uses this search engine,[15] and so does the MojoMojo wiki.[17] It is also used by the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)[18] and the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database (T3DB).[19] Swiftype – an enterprise search startup based on Lucene See also[edit] Free and open-source software portal Enterprise search Information extraction List of information retrieval libraries Text mining References[edit] ^ "Welcome to Apache Lucene".
