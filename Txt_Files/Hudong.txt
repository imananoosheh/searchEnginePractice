The system has some social networking-like interactive features, such as user profile, friends and groups. The first version was released in November 2006 and by November 2007 version 3 with added functions, features, and more stability was released.[10] The HDWiki software is free for non-commercial use, has been downloaded 200,000 times and currently supports over 1,000 other web sites in China (as of December 2007), consisting mostly of tech researchers, open source software groups, government, universities, and high school students.[citation needed] In 2011, it was announced that Draper Fisher Jurvetson had invested $15 million in Baike.com.[9] On 22 February 2012, Baike.com submitted a complaint to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce asking for a review of the behavior of Baidu, accusing it of being monopolistic.[11] In December 2012, the company changed its English name from Hudong to Baike.com.[12] Features[edit] Baike.com is a wiki and lets its users edit and contribute material. Frequent users may accumulate credits redeemable for gifts.[9] It has also included features of social networking sites, including chat forums and fan groups.[2][13] Baike.com is a for-profit business partially supported by advertising and paid support services.[2] Contributors grant Baike.com a perpetual royalty-free license to publish and re-use the content; it does not release the content under a free license and does not allow re-use on other sites.[7] See also[edit] China portal Internet portal Baidu Baike Chinese Wikipedia References[edit] ^ "Baike.com Traffic, Demographics and Competitors - Alexa".
