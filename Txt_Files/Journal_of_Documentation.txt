The journal publishes scholarly articles, research reports, and critical reviews.

It published quarterly between 1945 and 1996, expanding to five issues per year between 1997-1999. Since 2000, it is published bimonthly. It is currently edited by David Bawden (City University London.)[3] In celebration of the journal's 60th anniversary, a series of review articles were published between 2004-2006, which commented on the significance of eleven articles originally published in the Journal in the previous six decades.[4] The journal is published by Emerald Group Publishing.
