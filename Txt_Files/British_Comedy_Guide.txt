Type of site Online British comedy TV, radio and film guide. Host of British comedy podcasts. Owner Mark Boosey and Aaron Brown URL http://www.comedy.co.uk/ Registration Required to post (free) Launched August 2003 Current status Active British Comedy Guide or BCG (formerly the British Sitcom Guide or BSG) is a British website covering all forms of British comedy, across all media.[1][2] At the time of writing, BCG has published guides to more than 7,000 individual British comedies - primarily TV and radio situation comedy, sketch shows, comedy dramas, satire, variety and panel games. Other notable features on BCG include a news section, a message board, interviews with comedians and actors, a series of comment and opinion articles, a searchable merchandise database, and a section offering advice to aspiring comedy writers. The website also runs The Comedy.co.uk Awards and hosts several podcast series, some of which have won awards. Reportedly, British Comedy Guide attracts over 500,000 unique visitors a month, making it Britain's most-visited comedy-related reference website.[1][3] Contents 1 Background 2 Key people 3 Podcasts 4 The Comedy.co.uk Awards 4.1 2006 4.2 2007 4.3 2008 4.4 2009 4.5 2010 4.6 2011 4.7 2012 4.8 2013 4.9 2014 4.10 2015 4.11 2016 4.12 2017 4.13 2018 4.14 2019 5 Footnotes 6 References 7 External links Background[edit] The logo for the British Comedy Guide between 11 May 2009 – 1 January 2011. The BCG logo between 2 January 2011 and 15 January 2016. The website was founded in August 2003 as the British Sitcom Guide (BSG), a website devoted to British sitcom TV programmes. The website was established by Mark Boosey, a freelance web developer, originally as a hobby.[1] However, in 2008, it was decided to expand the remit of the website to cover all forms of British comedy, and thus the BSG was re-launched as British Comedy Guide or BCG, and has continued to expand since this point. Other features added since the site's re-launch in 2008 as British Comedy Guide include a series of podcasts, a section featuring interviews with people working in the British comedy industry and a Twitter-based news service. The website went through another relaunch in 2016, where it underwent a re-design of the layout, a new logo, and increased coverage of online comedy and people working in British comedy. In 2015, BCG's data specialist Ian Wolf was awarded the inaugural "Unsung Hero" at the first FringePig Ham Fist awards for his work collating reviews during that year's Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[4] Key people[edit] Ref Joined Person Job Title(s) [5] 2003 Mark Boosey Site Editor [6] 2005 Aaron Brown Site Editor [7] 2006 Ian Dunn (aka Ian Wolf) Data Specialist [8] 2009 Si Hawkins Regular Columnist Podcasts[edit] BCG hosts a range of podcasts, some of which have gone on to win awards.

The story was also reported widely across the media, including the BBC and Sky News.[13][14] The podcasts hosted by BCG are:[15] Name Year The Collings and Herrin Podcast 2008-2011 Richard Herring: As It Occurs To Me 2009-2011 What Are You Laughing At? 2011–Present Richard Herring's Edinburgh Fringe Podcast 2011–Present Me1 vs Me2 Snooker with Richard Herring 2011–Present Pappy's Flatshare Slamdown 2011–Present Do The Right Thing 2011–Present Talking Cock With Richard Herring 2012–2013 Live From Kirrin Island 2012–Present Mat Ricardo's London Varieties 2012–Present No Pressure To Be Funny 2011–Present Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast 2012–Present The John Dredge Nothing To Do With Anything Show 2013–Present The Comedian's Comedian with Stuart Goldsmith 2013–Present Richard Herring: We're All Going To Die 2013–Present Margaret Thatcher Queen of Podcasts 2015–Present Sitcom Geeks 2015–Present My Dad Wrote a Porno 2015–Present ManBuyCow 2015–Present Richard Herring: Happy Now? 2016–Present Isy Suttie's The Things We Do For Love 2016–Present The Adventures of Grett Binchleaf 2016–Present Hayley & Ruth: Two Stars 2016–Present The Comedy.co.uk Awards[edit] In January 2007, the website launched The British Sitcom Guide Awards, which were later renamed The British Comedy Guide Awards and are now known as The Comedy.co.uk Awards.[16] The awards are notable for allowing the public to choose the winners via an online poll, but with no shortlist - all broadcast programmes are available to choose. This differs from the British Comedy Awards which relies on broadcasters to put their programmes forward for nomination, and only uses a small panel of judges to determine the results. Additionally, The Comedy.co.uk Awards seeks to name not just the winners, but the worst programme in each category too.[17] In order to be considered for a Comedy.co.uk Award, a programme must be a British comedy which has had at least one new episode broadcast on British TV or radio between 1 January and 31 December of the previous year. The only exception is shows which span across the new year, in which case it is nominated only in the first of the years.[16] Up until the 2015 awards the visitors taking part in the poll are asked to give three votes in each category: one to their favourite show, one to their second favourite show, and one to their least favourite show. The vote for "top favourite" scores two points for the selected programme, and a vote for a "second favourite" scores one. The comedy programme with the most points is declared the winner in that category. The show which receives the highest number of "worst" votes is declared the worst comedy in that category. The 2016 awards change format, removing the "worst" categories, and people voting for the top three programmes, with their favourite show scoring three points, their second favourite two points, and their third favourite one point. In the first week of voting all comedies from the year could be voted on, in the second week the six most popular shows in every category formed a shortlist. All of the awards are voted for by the website's users except one, the British Comedy Guide Editors' Award, which is an award voted for just by the controllers of the guide, and is given "to the show, person, channel, or indeed anything else comedy related that deserves some recognition."[18] 2006[edit] The first awards were presented in January 2007 and were known at the time as The British Sitcom Guide Awards 2006, but have since been renamed.

Suspicion was also raised that a significant number of the negative votes may have been cast by users who had unsuccessfully submitted material for the series, and were voting against it as an act of revenge rather than as a fair reflection of its quality.[20] References[edit] ^ a b c "About the British Comedy Guide".
