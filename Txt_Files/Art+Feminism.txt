The project, founded by Siân Evans, Jacqueline Mabey, Michael Mandiberg, and Laurel Ptak,[1] has been described as "a massive multinational effort to correct a persistent bias in Wikipedia, which is disproportionately written by and about men".[2] In 2014, Art+Feminism's inaugural campaign attracted 600 volunteers at 30 separate events.[1][2] The following year, 1,300 volunteers attended 70 events in 17 countries, on four continents.[1] Contents 1 Establishment 2 Events 3 Reception 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Establishment[edit] Siân Evans, McKensie Mack, Michael Mandiberg, and Jacqueline Mabey (left to right). Art+Feminism started when Artstor librarian Siân Evans was designing a project for women and art for the Art Libraries Society of North America.[3] Evans talked with fellow curator Jacqueline Mabey, who had been impressed by Wikipedia contributors' organization of edit-a-thon events to commemorate Ada Lovelace.[3] Mabey spoke with Michael Mandiberg, a professor at the City University of New York who had been incorporating Wikipedia into classroom learning. Mandiberg in turn talked with Laurel Ptak, a fellow at the art and technology non-profit Eyebeam, who agreed to help plan the event.[3] The team then recruited local Wikipedians Dorothy Howard, then Wikipedian in residence at Metropolitan New York Library Council; and Richard Knipel, then representing the local chapter of Wikipedia contributors through Wikimedia New York City.[3] One reason for establishing the Art+Feminism project included responding to negative media coverage about Wikipedia's cataloging system.[4][5] The project continues to fill content gaps in Wikipedia and increase the number of female contributors.[6][7] Only about 17 percent of biographies on Wikipedia are about women and only about 15 percent of Wikipedia editors are female.[8] McKensie Mack was appointed Director of Art+Feminism in 2018.[9] Events[edit] Play media Video from an Art+Feminism edit-a-thon at the Museum of Modern Art, 2015 Outside the United States, the 2015 event received media coverage at locations including Australia,[10] Canada,[11] Cambodia,[12] India,[13] New Zealand,[14] and Scotland.[15] Inside the United States the event received media coverage at the flagship location in New York,[16] and also in California,[17][18] Kansas,[19] Pennsylvania,[20] Texas,[21] and West Virginia.[22] Reception[edit] Content contributed by participants in the editing events is tracked in a coordinating forum on Wikipedia.[23] In November 2014, Foreign Policy magazine named Evans, Mabey, Mandiberg, Richard Knipel, Dorothy Howard, and Ptak as "global thinkers" for addressing gender bias on Wikipedia.[24] See also[edit] Women in Red References[edit] ^ a b c "Art+Feminism's 2015 Wikipedia Edit-a-thon Adds 334 Articles on Female Artists".
