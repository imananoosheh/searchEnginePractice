(February 2012) This comparison of wiki hosting services details notable online services which host wiki-style editable web pages. General characteristics of cost, presence of advertising, licensing, and Alexa rank are compared, as are technical differences in editing, features, wiki engine, multilingual support and syntax support. An alternative to this page can be found on MediaWiki's site, at mw:Hosting services. The following table compares general information for several of the more than 100 wiki hosting services that have been created.[1] The Alexa traffic rankings are a snapshot that will vary over time. For wiki hosting services that allow hosted wikis to have separate domain names, the Alexa count might not be complete, as such wikis may have their own Alexa rankings.
