His father, Duke, once served as a fireman, real estate broker, state senator, and government official while his mother was a housewife.[10] He attended ?Iolani School and graduated in 1972.[11] Kawasaki graduated from Stanford University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.[11] He then attended law school at UC Davis, but quit after about a week of classes when he realized that he hated law school.[12][13] In 1977, he enrolled in the UCLA Anderson School of Management, where he earned an MBA degree.[11] While there, Kawasaki also worked at a jewelry company, Nova Stylings. Kawasaki observed, "The jewelry business is a very, very tough business, tougher than the computer business... I learned a very valuable lesson: how to sell."[14] Career[edit] External video The art of innovation Guy Kawasaki, TEDxBerkeley, TEDx, 21:15, February 22, 2014 Ten Words You Seldom Hear in Social Media, Social Data Week, September 16, 2013, 29:21 In 1983, Kawasaki got a job at Apple through his Stanford roommate, Mike Boich.[11][15] He was Apple's chief evangelist for four years. In a 2006 podcast interview on the online site Venture Voice, Kawasaki said, "What got me to leave is basically I started listening to my own hype, and I wanted to start a software company and really make big bucks."[16] In 1987 he was hired to lead ACIUS, the U.S. subsidiary of France-based ACI, which published an Apple database software system called 4th Dimension.[17] Kawasaki left ACIUS in 1989 to further his writing and speaking career. In the early 1990s he wrote columns that were featured in Forbes and MacUser magazines.[11][18][19] He also founded another company, Fog City Software, which created Emailer, an email client that sold to Claris.[20][21] A collection of software utilities called Guy's Utilities for Macintosh (GUM), which was named after Guy Kawasaki, was published by After Hours Software in the early 1990s.[22] An edition of GUM for PowerBook systems was acquired by Gordon Eubanks and was subsequently remarketed by Symantec as The Norton Essentials for PowerBook.[23][24] He returned to Apple as an Apple Fellow in 1995.[11] In 1998, he was a co-founder of Garage Technology Ventures, a venture capital firm that has made investments in Pandora Radio, Tripwire, The Motley Fool and D.light Design.[25][26] In 2007, he founded Truemors, a free-flow rumor mill, that sold to NowPublic.[27][28][29] He is also a founder at Alltop, an online magazine rack.[15][30] In March 2013 Kawasaki joined Google as an advisor to Motorola. His role was to create a Google+ mobile device community.[31] In April 2014, Kawasaki became the chief evangelist of Canva.[32] It is a free graphic design website for non-designers as well as professionals and was founded in 2012. On March 24, 2015, Kawasaki joined Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees.[33] He stood down at the end of December 2016.[7] On April 25, 2017, Wikitribune mentioned him as an adviser.[34] On February 26, 2019, Penguin Group released Wise Guy, described as Kawasaki's most personal book to date. While the book is written in what could be considered a memoir, it contains a series of vignettes that include various personal experiences that Kawasaki says have enlightened and inspired him.[35] Personal life[edit] Kawasaki and his wife Beth have four children, Nicodemus ("Nic"), Noah, Nohemi, and Nate.[36] Nohemi and Nate, a pair of biological sister and brother, were adopted by them from Guatemala.[37][38][39][better source needed] Bibliography[edit] The Macintosh Way (1990) ISBN 0-06-097338-2.
