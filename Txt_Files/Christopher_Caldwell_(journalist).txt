The Economist newspaper called it "an important book as well as a provocative one: the best statement to date of the pessimist’s position on Islamic immigration in Europe."[2] The Marxist historian Perry Anderson, though critical of his arguments, nonetheless called it "the most striking single book to have appeared, in any language, on immigration in Western Europe".[3] Others were more blunt, accusing Caldwell of stoking what The Guardian referred to as a "culture of fear".[4][5][6] Caldwell insists that he is "instinctively pro-immigration" and conscious of the media tendency to "sensationalize stories against Muslims".[7] In 2020 he published The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties, in which he argues that the civil rights movement has had significant unintended consequences: "Just half a decade into the civil rights revolution, America had something it had never had at the federal level, something the overwhelming majority of its citizens would never have approved: an explicit system of racial preference. Plainly the civil rights acts had wrought a change in the country’s constitutional culture."[8] Caldwell writes that the Civil Rights Act 1964 was "not just a major new element in the Constitution," but "a rival constitution, with which the original one was frequently incompatible."[9] It was reviewed in the New York Times[10] and the Wall Street Journal.[11] The WSJ wrote "It's curious that a book subtitled 'America Since the Sixties' doesn’t actually have much history in it." Jonathan Rauch wrote of Caldwell's book, "If you think Caldwell sounds like Bannon, the self-appointed tribune of Trumpian working-class populism, you’re right."[12] Personal life[edit] His wife Zelda is the daughter of journalist Robert Novak.[13] Caldwell has five children.[citation needed] His daughter Lucy Caldwell is the Campaign Manager for Joe Walsh's presidential campaign challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020.[14] Books[edit] Left Hooks, Right Crosses: A Decade of Political Writing (Nation books), edited by Christopher Hitchens and Christopher Caldwell.
