Citation needed - Wikipedia Citation needed From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article describes the history and effects of "citation needed". See Wikipedia:Citation needed for usage of the template "citation needed". See Template:Citation needed for the template. The display effect of the citation needed template in English Wikipedia "Citation needed" is a tag added by Wikipedia editors to unsourced statements in articles requesting citations to be added. The phrase is reflective of the policies of verifiability and no original research in Wikipedia and has become a general Internet meme.[1] Contents 1 Usage in Wikipedia 2 Usage outside Wikipedia 3 Notes 4 References Usage in Wikipedia[edit] By Wikipedia policy, editors should add citations for content, to ensure accuracy and neutrality, and to avoid original research.[2] In 2005, Chris Sherlock, a Wikipedia editor with the username Ta bu shi da yu, created the "citation needed" template, to be added to statements without a citation that needed verification.[3][4] The template is used frequently—as of December 2019[update], over 400,000 articles in the English Wikipedia are marked with the template.[5] Usage outside Wikipedia[edit] An xkcd comic featuring a protester with a "[citation needed]" placard In 2007, the webcomic xkcd published a comic called "Wikipedian Protester". In the comic, a group of people are listening to a politician's speech, and a protester raises a placard which says "[citation needed]",[6] in Wikipedia's characteristic blue color for links.[7] This is the first known use of the term outside Wikipedia.[1] This also spawned a meme, on the "explain xkcd" wiki, of placing a "citation needed" tag after obvious statements.[6] Randall Munroe, the creator of xkcd, has also used "[citation needed]" in similar fashion throughout his blog What If?,[6][8] and, consequently, in the book published as a compilation of the blog's entries.[9] In 2008, Matt Mechtley created stickers with "[citation needed]", encouraging people to stick them on advertisements.[10] This kind of graffiti has been dubbed "wikiffiti".[11] Quickly becoming an Internet meme, "[citation needed]" appeared not only on billboards, but also some internet kuso pictures. For example, someone doctored a photograph of George W. Bush's Mission Accomplished speech to place a "[citation needed]" label under the "mission accomplished" banner.[12] "Protesters" at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, 2010 In 2010, American television hosts Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert led the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Some "protesters" held placards with "[citation needed]".[13] In 2011, German defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg was facing accusations that he plagiarized his doctoral thesis. Protesters with "[citation needed]" placards called attention to the many contexts in his thesis where his sources were not labeled.[14] In 2014, YouTube creator Tom Scott started a reverse trivia show called "Citation Needed".[15][16] In 2017, the hosts of the Cognitive Dissonance podcast and the hosts of The Scathing Atheist podcast began working on a weekly podcast with the name Citation Needed. In the podcast, one of the cast is assigned to read an article on Wikipedia and prepares a comedic essay summarizing the article.[17] Notes[edit] ^ In the source, the first "[citation needed]" bears a link to a Google search for Chevrolet Citation on craigslist, while the second is a link to the Wikipedia article Citation (horse).
