Wikiquote - Wikipedia Wikiquote From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Free repository of quotes hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation For linking to or citing Wikiquote, see Wikipedia:Wikiquote. Wikiquote Screenshot of the wikiquote.org home page Type of site Quotation repository Available in Multilingual Owner Wikimedia Foundation Created by Daniel Alston, Brion Vibber and the Wikimedia community URL www.wikiquote.org Alexa rank 5,568 (January 2020[update])[1] Commercial No Registration Optional Launched 10 July 2003; 16 years ago (2003-07-10) Current status active Wikiquote is one of a family of wiki-based projects run by the Wikimedia Foundation, running on MediaWiki software. Based on an idea by Daniel Alston and implemented by Brion Vibber, the goal of the project, which began as an outgrowth to Wikipedia Famous Quotations, is to produce collaboratively a vast reference of quotations from prominent people, books, films, proverbs, etc. and to be as proper as possible in regard to the details of the quotations and also providing the appropriate human reference of the quotation. Though there are many online collections of quotations, Wikiquote is distinguished by being among the few that provide an opportunity for visitors to contribute[2] and the very few which strive to provide exact sources for each quotation as well as corrections of misattributed quotations. Wikiquote pages are cross-linked to articles about the notable personalities on Wikipedia.[3] Initially, the project was created solely in English; a later expansion to include additional languages was started in July 2004.[citation needed] Contents 1 History 2 Multi-lingual cooperation 3 Use in experiments 4 Reception 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Growth of the largest eight Wikiquotes until early 2008 The WikiQuote site originated in 2003.[4] The article creation milestones are taken from WikiStats.[5] Date Event 27 June 2003 Temporarily put on the Wolof language Wikipedia (wo.wikipedia.com). 10 July 2003 Own subdomain created (quote.wikipedia.org). 25 August 2003 Own domain created (wikiquote.org). 17 July 2004 New languages added. 13 November 2004 English edition reaches 2,000 pages.

It is also noted as a source from frequent misquotes and their possible origins.[12][13] It can be used for analysis to produce claims such as "Albert Einstein is probably the most quoted figure of our time".[14] See also[edit] meta:List of Wikiquotes Wikimedia Foundation Wiktionary References[edit] ^ "wikiquote.org Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic - Alexa". www.alexa.com.
