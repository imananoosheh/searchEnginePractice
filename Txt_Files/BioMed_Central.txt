(March 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) BioMed Central Parent company Springer Nature Status Active Founded 2000 (2000) Founder Current Science Group Headquarters location London, WC1 United Kingdom Distribution Open access Publication types Scientific journals Nonfiction topics Science Official website www.biomedcentral.com Logo of BioMed Central until 2018 BioMed Central (BMC) is a United Kingdom-based, for-profit scientific open access publisher that produces over 250 scientific journals. All its journals are published online only. BioMed Central describes itself as the first and largest open access science publisher. It was founded in 2000 and has been owned by Springer, now Springer Nature, since 2008.

SNG chairman Vitek Tracz developed the concept for the company after NIH director Harold Varmus's PubMed Central concept for open-access publishing was scaled back.[1] The first director of the company was Jan Velterop. Chemistry Central was established in 2006 and the PhysMath Central journal imprint in 2007. In 2002, the company introduced article processing charges,[2] and these have since been the primary source of revenue. In 2007 Yale University Libraries stopped subsidizing BioMed Central article processing charges for Yale researchers.[3] In October 2008, it was announced that BioMed Central (along with Chemistry Central and PhysMath Central) had been acquired by Springer Science+Business Media, the second largest STM publisher.[4] The Chemistry Central and PhysMath Central brands have since been retired. In November 2008, BioMed Central became an official supporting organisation of Healthcare Information For All.[5] Journals[edit] BioMed Central's flagship journals include BMC Biology, BMC Medicine, Genome Biology (impact factor 14.08)[6] and Genome Medicine. It also produces the BMC Series of journals covering the fields of biology and medicine. Most of the other journals published by BioMed Central are owned and produced independently by societies and academic editorial boards, with BioMed Central providing the hosting, publishing platform and marketing. All journals are published online; some of the flagship journals have in the past also been available as print subscriptions, such as Arthritis Research & Therapy. Publications in BioMed Central journals are, immediately upon publication, released under the Creative Commons "Attribution" license which grants permission to reuse publications and produce derivative work. The only exceptions to this (as of 2010) were the flagship journals, which reserved rights on review and commentary content; those articles were available to purchase on a subscription or on a pay-per-view basis, becoming freely available (but not fully open access) to all after six months; however, as of January 2015, "no subscription fees apply to these journals or to any articles published in them."[7] In 2001, BioMed Central was the first publisher to carry out open peer review as default, by openly posting named peer reviewer reports alongside published articles as part of a ‘pre-publication history’ for all medical journals in the BMC series. With currently 70 BMC journals operating fully open peer review.[8]. BMC Series[edit] The BMC Series is a collection of several dozen online research journals published by BioMed Central.[9] Like all other BioMed Central journals, they have a policy of open access to the research articles they publish. Between them, they cover all major subject areas within biology and medicine. Two of the journals, BMC Biology and BMC Medicine, have a broad scope, and aim to publish particularly significant research. A third journal, BMC Research Notes, publishes scientifically valid research outputs that cannot be considered as full research or methodology articles across all scientific and clinical disciplines[10], while BMC Proceedings publishes conference proceedings. The other journals specialise on a particular subject area. Due to their free licensing, images from BMC journals can be reused in other places.

As of 2016, for the 53 journals with impact factors, BMC Biology had the highest at 7.98.[6] Databases[edit] The company also has hosted biomedical databases, including Current Controlled Trials, a database of clinical trials.[11] The Biology Image Library and the Cases Database, a database of medical case reports,[12] were closed in 2014.[13] The company also provided hosting for institutional repositories of publications based on the DSpace platform under the brand Open Repository.[14] The Open Repository activity was sold to Atmire in 2016.[15] See also[edit] Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association, of which BioMed Central is a founding member Trials (journal) References[edit] ^ "Interview with Vitek Tracz: Essential for Science".
