Suber returned to Earlham College as a professor from 1982 to 2003 where he taught classes on philosophy, law, logic, and Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, among other topics. Suber participated in the 2001 meeting that led to the world's first major international open access initiative, the Budapest Open Access Initiative. He wrote Open Access News and the SPARC Open Access Newsletter, considered the most authoritative blog and newsletter on open access. He is also the founder of the Open Access Tracking Project, and co-founder, with Robin Peek, of the Open Access Directory. In philosophy, Suber is the author of The Paradox of Self-Amendment,[12] the first book-length study of self-referential paradoxes in law, and The Case of the Speluncean Explorers: Nine New Opinions,[13] the first book-length "rehearing" of Lon Fuller's classic, fictional case. He has also written many articles on self-reference, ethics, formal and informal logic, the philosophy of law, and the history of philosophy.[14] He has written many articles on open access to science and scholarship.[15] His 2012 book, Open Access, was published by MIT Press and released under a Creative Commons license.[1] His latest book is a collection of 44 of his most influential articles about open access, Knowledge Unbound: Selected Writings on Open Access, 2002–2010, also published by MIT Press under a Creative Commons license.[16] Suber has directed the development of TagTeam since its start in 2011.
