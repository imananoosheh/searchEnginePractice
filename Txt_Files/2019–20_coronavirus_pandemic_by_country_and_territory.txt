Notes ^ Countries and territories, and one international conveyance where cases were diagnosed. Nationality and location of original infection may vary. In some countries, the cases cover several territories, as noted accordingly. ^ Cumulative confirmed cases reported to date. The actual number of infections and cases are likely to be higher than reported.[1] ^ Total deaths may not necessarily add up due to the frequency of values updating for each individual location. ^ Recovered cases. All recoveries may not be reported. "–" denotes that no reliable data is currently available for that territory, not that the value is zero. Additionally, total recoveries may not necessairly add up due to the frequency of values updating for each individual location. ^ United States As of 28 March 2020[update], includes 149 cases, 3 deaths and 1 recovery in the Overseas Territories: Guam (51 cases; 1 death)[2] Puerto Rico (79 cases; 3 deaths; 1 recovery)[2] the U.S. Virgin Islands (17 cases)[2] as well as cases identified on the Grand Princess Data is from unofficial trackers and not from the official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ^ Italy Only at-risk people showing symptoms have been tested from 27 February 2020 and onwards.[4][5] ^ China Includes clinically diagnosed cases and deaths from 12 February 2020 and onwards in the province of Hubei. ^ Spain Only at-risk people showing symptoms have been tested.[8] ^ France As of 25 March 2020[update], includes 272 cases, 2 deaths and 7 recoveries in Overseas departments and regions: French Guiana (23 cases; 6 recoveries)[2] Guadeloupe (62 cases; 1 death)[2] Martinique (57 cases; 1 death)[2] Mayotte (36 cases)[2] Réunion (94 cases; 1 recovery)[2] , as well as 50 cases in Overseas collectivities: French Polynesia (25 cases)[2] New Caledonia (14 cases)[2] Saint Barthélemy (3 cases)[2] Saint Martin (8 cases)[2] ^ Iran Includes clinically diagnosed cases and deaths from 9 March 2020 and onwards. ^ United Kingdom As of 26 March 2020[update], includes 47 cases, 1 death and 5 recoveries in the British Overseas Territories, not counted in the UK government sources: Akrotiri and Dhekelia (3 cases) [14] Anguilla (2 cases)[2] Bermuda (6 cases)[15] The British Virgin Islands (2 cases)[2] The Cayman Islands (6 cases; 1 death)[16][17] Gibraltar (26 cases; 5 recoveries)[18] Montserrat (1 case)[2] The Turks and Caicos Islands (1 case)[2] ^ Netherlands As of 27 March 2020[update], includes 38 cases and 1 death in constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean: Aruba (28 cases)[2] Curaçao (7 cases; 1 death)[2] Sint Maarten (3 cases)[2] The Dutch Government agency RIVM, responsible for the constituent country the Netherlands, does not count its number of recoveries.[23] ^ Norway From 13 March 2020, testing of the normal population was discontinued, and is now only reserved for health professionals and acutely ill people in vulnerable groups. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health states that there are more infected people in Norway than the figures show. The dark figures are presumed to be higher because of limited testing.[32] Nevertheless, the total number of tests per capita was as of 20 March comparatively high in Norway.[33] Estimation of number of coronavirus infected: As of 23 March 2020, over 40% of all GPs in Norway have been registered 20,200 patients with the "corona code" R991. The figure includes both cases where the patient has been diagnosed with coronavirus infection through testing, and where the GP has used the "corona code" after assessing the patient's symptoms against the criteria by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.[34] As of 24 March 2020, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health estimates that between 7,120 and 23,140 Norwegians are infected with the coronavirus.[35] ^ Australia Excluding the cases from Diamond Princess cruise ship which are classified as "on an international conveyance". Ten cases, including one fatality recorded by the Australian government. ^ Sweden Testing of suspected infections has been cut back in the whole country in the period around 12 March 2020, in order to focus efforts on people with increased risk of serious illness and complications. ^ Denmark As of 27 March 2020[update], includes 153 cases in constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark: Faroe Islands (144 cases; 0 deaths)[42][43] Greenland (9 cases; 0 deaths)[44][43] The Danish Government does not report the number of recoveries.[45] From 12 March 2020, the criteria for testing has been changed; only people with more serious symptoms and health professionals are being tested.[46] ^ Finland As of 25 March 2020[update], includes 5 cases in the autonomous region of Åland Islands.[64] Testing is limited to severely ill or at-risk patients and social or health care workers.[65][66] ^ Russia Including cases from the disputed Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014 but remains internationally recognized as being under Ukrainian sovereignty. Excluding the cases from Diamond Princess cruise ship which are classified as "on an international conveyance". One fatality was not officially recorded by the Russian authorities as caused by coronavirus.[68][69][70] ^ Diamond Princess The British cruise ship Diamond Princess was in Japanese waters, and Japanese administration was asked to manage its quarantine, with the passengers having not entered Japan. Therefore, this case is neither included in the Japanese government's official count nor in United Kingdom's one. The World Health Organization classifies the cases as being located "on an international conveyance". ^ Serbia Excluding Kosovo.[91] ^ Egypt Includes cases identified on the MS River Anuket. ^ Ukraine Excluding cases from the disputed Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014 but remains internationally recognized as being under Ukrainian sovereignty. Because the Russian authorities are tabulating cases from Crimea, they are included in the Russian total. ^ Moldova Includes data from the unrecognised state of Transnistria.[124] ^ Cyprus Excluding Northern Cyprus ^ Cuba Includes cases on the MS Braemar. Confirmed cases As of 27 March 2020, a total of 585,040edit cases were confirmed with 428,409edit active cases and 26,819edit deaths in 181 countries and territories, including five cruise ships.[210] Statistics Main page: Template:2019–20 coronavirus pandemic data/International medical cases Africa Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Africa Cases have been confirmed in most African countries and territories. According to Michael Yao, WHO's head of emergency operations in Africa, early detection is vital because the continent's health systems "are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks".[211][212] As of 25 March, cases have been confirmed in all African nations except for Botswana, Burundi, Comoros, Lesotho, Malawi, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and the disputed states of Somaliland and Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. There have been no reported cases in the territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, but there have been suspected cases. Asia Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Asia A cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases was detected in December 2019 in Wuhan and eventually spread to the rest of China.[213] Afterwards, many other Asian countries started to confirm cases, with some of the most affected countries being South Korea, Malaysia, and Iran. Sophisticated modelling of the outbreak suggests that while the number of cases in China would have been many times higher without interventions such as early detection and isolation of the infected, 66% fewer people would have been infected if China had implemented measures as little as a week earlier.[214] As of 21 March, cases have been reported in all Asian countries except for Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — while North Korea and Yemen have suspected cases. No cases have been reported in the disputed states Abkhazia, Republic of Artsakh, South Ossetia and external territories Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Europe Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe Initial cases in Europe were reported in France, Germany and other countries with a relatively low number of cases. On 21 February, a large outbreak was reported in Italy, mostly in the north near Milan. Cases grew rapidly as the outbreak spread across Europe. Cases have been reported in all European countries after Montenegro reported a case on 17 March, and in all European territories after the Isle of Man on 19 March, the disputed state of Transnistria on 21 March[215] and Åland Islands on 22 March reported cases. No cases have been reported in Svalbard, Alderney, Sark and self controlled territories of the Luhansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic[216]. The WHO has declared Europe as the new centre of the virus after the situation improved in China.[217] As of 24 March, there have been 200,000 confirmed cases and 10,400 deaths in Europe; out of these, 64,000 cases and 6,100 deaths were in Italy.[218] North America Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in North America The first cases in North America were reported in the United States in January 2020. Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on 25 March, and in all North American territories except Bonaire, Saba, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and Sint Eustatius (as of 26 March). Oceania Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Oceania Cases have been confirmed in Australia, Easter Island, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. The first confirmed case was in Melbourne, Victoria on 25 January.[219] Many small Pacific island nations have thus far avoided the outbreak by closing their borders. Cases have been reported in all Oceanian sovereign states except Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, and have not been reported in the associated states of Cook Islands and Niue. No cases have been reported in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Norfolk Island, Wallis and Futuna, Tokelau, Pitcairn Islands, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands. South America Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic in South America As of 19 March, cases have been confirmed in all South American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela and the French overseas department of French Guiana. No cases have been reported in the Falkland Islands, but there have been suspected cases. The coronavirus was first reported in South America on 26 February when Brazil confirmed a case in São Paulo. Since then, governments across the region have taken an array of actions to protect their citizens and contain the spread of COVID-19.[220] International conveyance Main article: 2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships The outbreak spread to several cruise ships including the Diamond Princess, the Grand Princess, the World Dream, the MS Westerdam and the MS Braemar.[221][222][223][224] Cruise operators have started to either cancel or change their itineraries as countries across the world implement travel restrictions to curb the disease spread. Ports are refusing to accept cruise ships that have been either to Chinese ports or are carrying Chinese passengers during the outbreak. The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), which represents 90% of cruise operators, announced the various precautionary measures being implemented by its members. All passengers who have travelled to or visited/transited through China, Hong Kong and Macau within 14 days before embarkation will be denied entry into cruise ships. Any persons in close contact with either suspected or diagnosed cases of coronavirus infection will also be denied entry.[225] Entities without confirmed cases Below is a list of countries and territories with no confirmed cases of COVID-19 (as of 25 March 2020), in order of greatest population. Locations with suspected cases are in italics and noted with an asterisk (*). UN member states As of 25 March 2020, 22 sovereign states (all in Africa, Asia, or Oceania) have not confirmed any cases of COVID-19.
