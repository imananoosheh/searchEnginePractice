Wikibaekkwa The Korean Wikipedia (Korean: ??? ????, romanized: Han-gugeo Wikibaekgwa) is the Korean language edition of the Wikipedia. It was founded in October 2002 and reached ten thousand articles on 4 June 2005.[2] As of September 2019, it has 467,704 articles and is the 23rd largest Wikipedia.[3] In June 2019, the project had 2,401 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Statistics 3 Topics 4 Hangul and Hanja 5 Dialects 6 Services derived from Korean Wikipedia 7 Politics 8 Gallery 9 Notes 10 External links History[edit] The Korean Wikipedia initially used an older version of MediaWiki. The software had problems representing Hangul, which limited usage. In August 2002, the software was upgraded and started to support non-English scripts such as hangul.[4] However, Internet Explorer continued to have an encoding problem, which kept contributions to the encyclopedia low.[5] Nevertheless, from October 2002 to July 2003, the number of articles increased from 13 to 159, and in August 2003 it reached 348. Finally, in September 2003 the hangul problem was solved. From September 2003, with no accessing difficulty once the encoding error in IE was solved, the number of contributions and visits increased. The Korean Wikipedia's prospects became even more optimistic following the momentum created by substantial coverage in the Korean media. The Korean Wikipedia won the Information Trust Award in the general Internet culture branch in 2005.[citation needed][importance?] Statistics[edit] Number of Articles Date Article 1 12 October 2002 ?? ?? 10,000 5 June 2005 ???? 20,000 12 February 2006 ??????? ?? ?? 30,000 14 December 2006 ??? ?? 40,000 2 August 2007 ??? ?? 50,000 4 January 2008 ??? 60,000 24 April 2008 ??? 70,000 7 August 2008 ???? 80,000 20 November 2008 ???? ???? 90,000 25 February 2009 ???? 100,000 4 June 2009 ???? 110,000 26 August 2009 ?? 120,000 18 November 2009 ????? ??? 130,000 13 March 2010 ?????? ? 140,000 4 July 2010 ??? ??? 150,000 15 December 2010 ???

Topics[edit] In 2019 the Korean Wikipedia has 269 thousand unique categories and 7.73% of them do not have appropriate page in the category namespace. The average article in this language version has 10 categories, while number of unique categories per articles ratio is 0.596. The largest number of articles has Politics (18%) and People (9%) category. In Korean Wikipedia articles related to Military and Philosophy has the highest average quality. Content about Business is read more often and articles in People category have the highest authors' interest on average.[6] Hangul and Hanja[edit] See also: Hanja and Korean mixed script The Korean Wikipedia is written almost entirely in hangul. Hanja is only used in order to clarify certain phrases, and is usually parenthesized. There is a group, named Dajimo, that is actively working to introduce a mixed script system to the Korean Wikipedia. A request for a separate Wikipedia in mixed script, however, was rejected.[7] Dialects[edit] See also: Korean dialects and Names of Korea There are two major standards in the Korean language, the South Korea standard, and the North Korea standard. North Koreans are underrepresented on the Korean Wikipedia, due to North Korean censorship of the Internet in North Korea. Therefore, most users of the Korean Wikipedia are South Koreans and most articles are written in the South Korean style. The official name of the Wikipedia is ??? ???? Hangugeo Wiki-baekgwa. Hangugeo is the name for the Korean language in South Korea, and baekgwa is a clipped form of ???? baekgwasajeon "encyclopedia".
