Contents 1 Personal life and death 2 Career 3 Notes 4 References 5 External links Personal life and death[edit] Gomolka was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc?aw, Poland).[1] He had a PhD in geography.[2] He was married and had four children.[1] At one point, Gomolka attempted to set up a new radio station. However, he was unable to compete with Norddeutscher Rundfunk.[2] Gomolka died on 24 March 2020, aged 77.[3] Career[edit] Gomolka was a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU).[3] He joined the CDU at a young age,[2] though he was at times unhappy with the party's alliance with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED).[2][4] He served on the Greifswald City Council when the area was part of East Germany.[2] Following German reunification, he served as the first minister president[a] of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern from October 1990 until 1992.[3][4] In 1990, the CDU took 33 of the 66 seats in the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state parliament, but was aided by one person transferring from the SED to the CDU and two MPs from the Free Democratic Party (FDP).[5][6] In 1992, Gomolka was involved in the shipyard crisis,[1][7] a disagreement between Gomolka and the German Minister for Transport and CDU regional party leader Günther Krause over shipyard policies.[2] Gomolka had wanted to rebuild and then privatise German shipbuilding, whereas Krause wanted to immediately sell the shipyards.[2] They also disagreed on how many ships to sell to Bremer Vulkan.[8] Krause accused Gomolka of incompetence over his handling of the crisis.[7] Krause then overturned Gomolka's shipyard policies.[9] As a result of the crisis, the CDU lost trust in Gomolka, and he left his role as minister president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.[1] He remained as a state MP until 1994[4][1] and was replaced by Berndt Seite as minister president.[2] From November 1991 until March 1992, Gomolka also served as the president of the German Bundesrat, before being replaced by Berndt Seite.[10][11] From 1994 until 2009, Gomolka was an MEP, representing the CDU.[3][1] He focused upon improving relations with the Baltic states, and was an advocate for Latvia's entry into the European Union.[1] He served as the chairman of the EU delegation to the EU-Latvia Joint Parliamentary Committee.[12] After leaving the EU Parliament, he served as leader of the CDU Seniors' Union for northeast Germany until 2015.[2] Notes[edit] ^ Some sources say Prime Minister References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g "Ex-MV-Ministerpräsident Alfred Gomolka gestorben".
