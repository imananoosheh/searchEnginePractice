The 1,338-acre (541.5 ha) main academic and residential campus is 15 miles (24 km) south of Toledo, Ohio. The university has nationally recognized programs and research facilities in the natural and social sciences, education, arts, business, health and wellness, humanities and applied technologies.[4] The institution was granted a charter in 1910 as a normal school, specializing in teacher training and education, as part of the Lowry Normal School Bill that authorized two new normal schools in the state of Ohio. Over the university's history, it developed from a small rural normal school into a comprehensive public university. As of 2019, Bowling Green offered over 200 undergraduate programs,[5] as well as master's and doctoral degrees through eight academic colleges. Its academic programs have been nationally ranked by Forbes magazine, U.S. News & World Report, and Washington Monthly. The University is also ranked the most affordable college in Ohio by Business Insider in 2018.[6] Additionally, in 2018 BGSU received designation as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity (IEP) university by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) and its Commission on Innovation, Competitiveness, and Economic Prosperity.[7] The 2011 Carnegie Foundation classified BGSU as having "high research activity". Research projects in the areas of psychology, sociology, education and human development, energy and sustainability are among the most prominent.[8] BGSU had an on-campus residential student population of approximately 6,000 students[9] and a total enrollment of over 19,000 students as of 2018[update].[10] The university also maintains a satellite campus, known as BGSU Firelands, in Huron, Ohio, 60 miles (97 km) east of the main campus. Although the majority of students attend classes on BGSU's main campus,[10][11] about 2,000 students attend classes at Firelands and about 600 additional students attend online. About 85% of Bowling Green's students are from Ohio.[10] The university hosts an extensive student life program, with over 300 student organizations. Fielding athletic teams known as Bowling Green Falcons, the university competes at the NCAA Division I level (FBS for football) as a member of the Mid-American Conference in all sports except ice hockey, in which the university is a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. The campus is home to annual events including the Dance Marathon (a student-organized philanthropy event)[12] and State Fire School.[13] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early history 1.1.1 Background 1.1.2 Lowry Bill 1.1.3 Founding 1.2 Early growth and development 1.2.1 Early Expansion 1.2.2 The Great Depression 1.3 World War II, Post-war era expansion 1.4 McDonald era 1.5 1960–1990: Diverse Growth 1.6 1990-2008 1.7 Recent history 2 Campuses 2.1 Main 2.1.1 Old Campus 2.1.2 Science Research Complex 2.1.3 Student life facilities 2.1.4 Arts facilities 2.1.5 Athletic and recreation facilities 2.1.6 Transportation and safety 2.2 BGSU Firelands 3 Academics and organization 3.1 Tuition and graduation rates 3.2 Faculty and research 3.3 Presidents 4 Athletics 4.1 Club sports and events 5 Student life 5.1 Demographics 5.2 Student Organizations 5.3 Curriculum 5.3.1 BGeXperience 5.3.2 GeoJourney 5.3.3 Outdoor Program 5.4 Student housing 5.5 Greek life 5.6 Media and publications 5.6.1 Newspaper 5.6.2 Broadcasting 5.6.3 Journals 5.7 Traditions and events 5.7.1 Mascots 5.7.2 Events 5.8 Marching band 6 Notable alumni 7 References 8 External links History[edit] Early history[edit] First known photograph of the campus, taken in 1910 before buildings were erected. Background[edit] The movement for a public high learning institution in northwestern Ohio began in the late 1800s as part of the growth in public institutions during the Progressive Era to meet demands for training and professional development of teachers.[14][15] During the period, people of northwestern Ohio campaigned for a school in their region to produce better quality education and educators.[15] The movement argued that the existing universities, Ohio State University in Columbus, Miami University in Oxford and Ohio University in Athens, were distant and the region lacked a state-supported school of its own.[15] Lowry Bill[edit] In 1910, the Ohio General Assembly passed the Lowry Normal School Bill that authorized Governor Judson Harmon to appoint the Commission on Normal School Sites to survey forty communities for two sites for normal schools, one in northeastern Ohio and one in northwestern Ohio.[16] The commission examined population within a 25-mile (40.2 km) radius of each community, along with railroad and transportation infrastructure, the moral atmosphere, health and sanitary conditions and site suitability.[15] Bowling Green offered four possible sites and became one of four finalists including Fremont, Napoleon, and Van Wert.[15] Despite the town being the home of John Lowry, Napoleon was ruled out because the commission found it had numerous saloons.[15] Fremont was eliminated mainly due to the specific stipulations imposed by the President Rutherford B. Hayes Memorial Commission.[15] Bowling Green was chosen on November 10, 1910, over Van Wert in a 3–2 vote by the commission.[15] The site located on 82.5 acres (0.334 km2) of primarily rural land and a small town park,[17] nearby railroad and transportation infrastructure, its central location in the region, and Bowling Green's dry status were major factors that the town was chosen by the commission.[15] At the same time, the commission chose Kent for a school in Northeastern Ohio.[16] Over the years 1911 and 1912, the Board of Trustees was appointed by the Governor and elected a school president on February 16, 1912.[16] A campus plan was created and $150,000 was appropriated to develop the campus and construct the first buildings.[18] Founding[edit] Bowling Green Normal School in 1915 The school opened on September 15, 1914, as Bowling Green State Normal School in two temporary locations at the Bowling Green Armory and at a branch school in Toledo for the 1914–1915 academic year.[16][19] The first honorary organization of the college, the Book and Motor was conceived around this time.[20] It initially enrolled 304 students from Ohio, Michigan, and New York who were taught by 21 faculty members.[14] The school graduated its first class in 1915, consisting of 35 certified teachers. University Hall and Williams Hall opened that year, the school's first two permanent buildings. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees for teacher education were awarded. The university began to invite notable guests to campus during the 1917-1918 semester, including the Zoellner Quartet, and the Ben Greet Shakespearean Players.[21] On March 28, 1920, a tornado, part of the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, damaged three of the school's buildings.[22] The tornado touched down near Bowling Green and strengthened as it moved into Ottawa County where it killed two people in Genoa.[23]. In May 1920, the University hosted its 6th music festival, featuring Modest Altschuler directing two concerts performed by the Russian Symphony Orchestra Society.[24] Early growth and development[edit] Early Expansion[edit] Over the next decade the school expanded academic facilities, athletics and student life, as enrollment grew to over 900 students.[25] On October 28, 1927, Ivan "Doc" Lake, a BGSU graduate and sports editor of the Daily Sentinel-Tribune, established the nickname “Falcons".[26] Lake thought the falcon was a fitting nickname because the falcon is a small but powerful bird of prey, and like the athletes, goes through extensive preparations and training. He also thought the nickname fit with the school's colors.[27] Prior to Lake's creation of the nickname, sports writers used various others, including: “B.G. Normals,” “Teachers,” and the “B.G. Pedagogues".[27] The school achieved the status of college in 1929 when the Emmons-Hanna Bill renamed it to Bowling Green State College (BGSC).[15][28] At the same time, the college expanded its curriculum through the addition of the College of Liberal Arts, now known as the College of Arts and Sciences.[14][29] The Great Depression[edit] Aerial view of the campus, circa early 1930s. Enrollment levels held steady into the Great Depression,[15] with enrollment surpassing 1,000 for the first time in 1931.[30] However, in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission proposed a plan to convert the school into a mental health institution.[31] Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal.[15] The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote.[15] A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and changed its name to Bowling Green State University. The university added the College of Business Administration to the existing College of Education and College of Liberal Arts.[32] Within a year BGSU added master's degree programs in Education, English, History, Social Science and Mathematics.[15][32] In 1938 the University adopted an official tenure policy.[33] In 1939, the university established The Committee for Gifts, Endowments, and Memorials, its first private endowment fund.[34] World War II, Post-war era expansion[edit] Navy and Marines performing drills on the BGSU campus during World War II in 1945. The 1940s, including World War II and its aftermath, brought big changes to BGSU. The war caused a drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing the lack of male students.[35] The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falcon's Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport.[35][36] Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities to take part in the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war.[37] The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college courses as well as naval training.[15] Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs.[38] Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives.[38]In July 1944 the University was selected by officials at Camp Perry as a potential temporary prisoner of war camp.[39] In the post-war era, BGSU constructed temporary structures to keep up with the increased housing demands for veterans and their families.[40] BGSU added 40 trailers to house male and married students in 1945, known as "Falcon Heights".[40] In 1946, the university added 15 steel buildings to house male students in an area near the football stadium that became known as "Tin Pan Alley".[40] By the late 1940s, the student house shortage became so severe that the nearby National Guard Armory and ODOT garage were converted to house male students.[40] The Federal Housing Authority provided two wooden barracks, ten trailers, and more steel buildings.[40] The BGSU Army ROTC was established on campus in 1948 as enrollment increased dramatically in the post war era.[41] The university continued to add academic programs as the enrollment increased during the mid to late 1940s, including the Graduate School in 1948 after Dr. Emerson Shuck led the effort to create school.[41] By 1950, enrollment grew to new record highs, with over 5,000 students.[15] McDonald era[edit] 1951 saw major changes when Ralph W. McDonald was appointed the fourth president in school history, following the retirement of Frank Prout.[15] McDonald was the first university president from outside Ohio and came to BGSU with a focus on improving teacher education and certification standards. Prior to becoming president, he served as the Executive Secretary of the Department of Higher Education of the National Education Association for seven years.[15] Under McDonald, BGSU reorganized its three colleges to group common departments together within each college.[15] Reflecting the Cold War era, BGSU added an Air Force ROTC program and a Department of Air Science and Tactics.[42] BGSU continued to add programs and in the early 1950s added a Master of Education (M.Ed.) and a Master of Science (M.S.) in Education.[15] The university constructed new residence halls during the decade, Prout Hall in 1955 and Founders Quadrangle in 1957.[43] The new student center opened in 1958, after four years of construction at a cost of $2.75 million.[44] In the years 2012–2014, the residence hall was renovated and remodeled. This renovation updated the rooms, bathrooms, lobbies and outside sidewalks and walkways. 1960–1990: Diverse Growth[edit] The Mathematical Sciences Building was completed in 1970 at a final cost of $7.2 million. The College of Education experienced rapid growth and expansion during the 1960s when the university added various specialized education programs, including majors in special education, school psychology, guidance and counseling and vocational rehabilitation counseling.[15] It expanded arts and music programs when the music department became the College of Education's first "school", renamed the School of Music in 1961.[15] Specializations in guidance and counseling were added to the Master of Arts and Master of Education degrees in 1964; as well as a new department for teaching college administration.[15] By 1965, BGSU's College of Education enrolled 5,470 students and was ranked the 16th largest producer of teachers in the United States.[15] The university added new academic, administrative, and athletic facilities during the 1960s. Memorial Hall, later known as Anderson Arena, opened in 1960.[45] The new Administration Building opened in 1964 and the William T. Jerome Library opened in 1967.[46][47] Student activism became common in the 1960s, reflecting the various social and political events of the time period. Vietnam War protests were common in downtown Bowling Green and on campus.[48] In 1969, a Black Student Union formed to encourage unity, scholarship, leadership, culture and political awareness of African Americans students.[48][49] The majority of student activism at BGSU was peaceful and Bowling Green was the only public college or university in Ohio to reopen in the spring of 1970, following the Kent State shootings during anti-war protests.[50][51] Bowling Green added two colleges in the early 1970s when the College of Health and Human Services opened in 1973 and the School of Music was elevated to the College of Musical Arts in 1975.[52] In addition to the new colleges, the BGSU Popular Culture Center opened in 1970 as one of the first pop culture centers in the United States.[53] In 1978, the university established the University Honors Program.[50] Throughout the 1970s construction continued, starting with the Mathematical Sciences Building,[53][54] followed by the Offenhauer Towers in 1971 and Industrial Education & Technology Building in 1972. The Business Building and the Industrial Arts Building opened in 1973 and University Hall received renovations in 1974 that included new seating, an improved sound system, and air conditioning in the auditorium.[55][56] In 1979, the Student Recreation Center and the Moore Musical Arts Center opened.[50] In 1970, the Board of Trustees ended an alcoholic beverage ban on campus. The Cardinal Room, an on-campus eatery, began serving beer.[53] A growing trend in the late 1960s and early 1970s was the development of large apartment complexes adjacent to campus.[53][57] By the 1970s approximately 4,000 students lived in private, off-campus housing.[53] On campus, Darrow Hall became the first co-ed residence hall in 1972 with men and women inhabiting alternating floors.[58] In 1975, the University hosted the second ever ACM SIGGRAPH conference.[59] In 1981 the university hosted Xing-Fang Olu, a geneticist from Fudan University to study cytogenetics, and sent its own Dr. Jong Sik Yoon to teach at Fudan in return. This was the first such exchange in Ohio since the founding of the People's Republic of China.[60] In 1984, ties were strengthened with Fudan University, along with then Xi'an Foreign Language Institute, following a visit to china by university president Olscamp, and establishment of more regular exchange programs.[61] The School of Technology was given college status in 1985 and renamed the College of Technology. The university expanded many of the technology and science facilities during the 1980s, including constructing the Planetarium and Physical Sciences Building.[62] In 1985 Ronald Reagan became the seventh president or president to-be to visit the university after Warren G. Harding, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford.[14][15] On June 2nd, 1986, the University registered bgsu.edu, making it the 44th institution to possess a .edu domain name. 1990-2008[edit] One of the newest Residence halls at BGSU, Falcon Heights opened in Fall 2011. During the 1990s the university renovated and constructed many buildings. The BGSU Fine Arts Center received a $9.8 million addition in the early 1990s. Founders Hall was reopened in 1994 after extensive renovations at a cost of $15 million. That same year BGSU opened Olscamp Hall. East Hall opened in 1998. All residence halls received wiring for Ethernet connections by 1997.[63] In 1996 student government elections began allowing for Electronic voting over the internet.[64] In 1997 President Bill Clinton visited the University.[65] In 1993 the Electric Vehicle Institute of the College of Technology began working on an electric race-car known as the Electric Falcon, and had it racing by 1994. The vehicle used a liquid cooled 255 horsepower three phase AC induction motor and reached a top speed of 140 mph. The vehicle was donated to the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum in 2010.[66] In 2006 the university established an electro-mechanical systems technology program.[67] Recent history[edit] The Oaks Dining Hall In 2008, the university began the first phase of a $200 million renovation project. BGSU first announced plans for the Stroh Center, a 5,000-seat arena to replace the aging Anderson Arena.[68] The $36 million arena opened in September 2011, hosting basketball and volleyball; in addition to graduation ceremonies, concerts and other events.[68] The arena was named for Kermit Stroh and Mary Lu Stroh, who donated $7.7 million for the project, the largest single private gift in BGSU's history.[68] In 2009 the university began construction on the Wolfe Center for the Arts.[69] The 93,000-square-foot (8,600 m2) facility opened in 2011 with performance space, as well as work and classroom areas for art studies of the School of Art, the Department of Theatre and Film, and the School of Musical Arts.[70] The facility was designed by Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta, the firm's first American project.[69] That same year, BGSU built a $40 million residence hall project that included two new residence halls,[71] one a traditional-style dorm and a second suite-style for upperclassmen.[71] The residence hall project added more than 800 beds.[72] In the fall of 2011, BGSU opened The Oaks dining hall.[73][74] The Oaks was constructed with sustainable designs that included a hybrid solar and wind power system to fulfill Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an electric-powered truck to distribute food on campus, and a rooftop garden. The building used sustainable and recycled construction materials.[75] In Fall of 2016 the university began offering a degree in Mechatronics engineering.[76] In 2016 and 2017, three major renovations were complete to three original campus building, totaling about $70 million.[77] The former South Hall was re-opened in fall 2016 after undergoing a $24 million renovation and renaming to The Michael and Sarah Kuhlin Center. The building is home to BGSU's School of Media and Communications.[78] Following a $25 million renovation and restoration, University Hall re-opened in Fall 2017.[79] It was originally built in 1915 as one of the first buildings on campus and represents a tie to the University past while recognizing technology and new ways of learning in today's educational environment. Today, University Hall houses the Office of Admissions, cutting-edge classrooms emphasizing technology, and active learning spaces.[80] Also, in Fall 2017, Moseley Hall reopened, following a $21 million restoration and renovation.[81] Moseley Hall, built in 1916, originally housed the University's agricultural science program. Today, it features technologically advanced laboratories for chemistry, biology, geology, and medical lab science.[82] In January 2019 the university began offering a winter session, with an enrollment of at least 1,000 students.[83] In November 2019 the Computer Science Department celebrated its 50th anniversary, with former Stanford University Computer Science chair Dr. Alex Aiken and Dr. David Fulton giving speeches.[84] Campuses[edit] Main[edit] The main campus skyline. The main academic and residential campus is located on the northeast side of Bowling Green. The campus is arranged in a rectangle roughly 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and 1 mile (1.6 km) wide. It includes over 116 buildings on 1,338 acres (5.41 km2).[52] The campus is bordered by Wooster Street to the south, Thurstin Avenue to the west, Poe Road to the north, and I-75 to the east. The university also owns buildings and parking lots throughout Bowling Green and the Bowling Green Research Enterprise Park just east of I-75. Ridge Street and East Merry Street run east–west through campus and Mercer Street bisects campus on a north–south axis. Old Campus[edit] Moseley Hall built in 1916 The oldest portion of the BGSU campus is located in the southwest corner and hosts the original campus buildings. This area offers green space with large trees and historic buildings built in the early 1900s. Administrative services and classrooms occupy these buildings. Although not part of the historic section, Founders Hall, a large dorm, is located on the Southwest corner. Hanna Hall housed The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Film Theater and Gallery prior to its renovation as the Maurer Center. Dedicated to BGSU in 1976, it features early film memorabilia and highlights the careers of both Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. The theater was renovated and rededicated in 1990. It seated 168 and was home to Tuesdays at the Gish, an International Film Series, and a Sunday Matinee Series, which were free and open to the community.[85] On May 3, 2019, the trustees voted to remove the Gish name from the theatre following calls to do so from the Black Student Union and a subsequent a task force report, which found that naming the theatre after Lillian Gish created a non-inclusive learning environment due to her involvement with The Birth of a Nation.[86][87] Science Research Complex[edit] The Science Research Complex is located on the northwest side of campus. The buildings of the science research complex were built in the mid-60s. They include Mathematical Science, Life Science, Psychology, Physical Science, and Technology (engineering).[54][88] The Geology, Chemistry and Earth Science departments are located in Overman Hall.[89] Student life facilities[edit] Three large residence halls occupy the western edge of campus. Offenhauer Towers consist of a ten-story and an eleven-story tower, connected by a first-floor lobby.[90] Offenhauer shelters a small convenience store.[90] McDonald Hall houses over 1,200 students.[91] The western edge hosts The Oaks, an eco-friendly dining facility. Falcon Heights, a new residence hall, was added in 2011 across from Offenhauer Towers.[74] Fresh snow covers the lawn near the Student Union. The Bowen-Thompson Student Union opened in 2002 in the west-central part of campus.[44] It houses eateries including The Falcon's Nest food court, Starbucks and The Black Swamp Pub. Other facilities include Falcon Outfitters, convenience store, computer labs, meeting rooms, a 250-seat movie theater, ballrooms, and various student lounges.[92] Central Campus features large lecture halls and classroom buildings. One of the most prominent is the 95,000 sq ft (9,000 m2) Olscamp Hall, which contains 28 classrooms and lecture halls capable of seating a total of 2,000 students. Others include Business Administration, Education, Math/Science and the Eppler Complex, home to the Sport Management department. Anderson Arena is a 5,000-seat arena, current home for BGSU women's gymnastics and former home of BGSU men's and women's basketball and volleyball. Memorial Hall is connected to Anderson and houses the college's ROTC programs.[93] Jerome Library is the main library on campus and the second tallest building at nine stories. Conklin North is another residence hall in the central portion of campus.[94] Oak Grove Cemetery is located in the north-central portion of campus.[95] Bowling Green State University opened the Falcon health center in 2013, after demolishing the Popular Culture building in 2012.[96] The Falcon Health Center is located across Wooster Street from the Education Building.[97] The Health and Human Services building is located near the Library.[98] The BGSU campus police station as well as counseling services are located in the College Park Office Building on the southern edge. Kohl Hall is a dormitory exclusive to members of the Chapman Learning Community, Partners in Context and Community for Urban Educators.[99] A new, predominantly freshman dormitory known as Centennial Hall was established in 2011 and is adjacent to the Carillon Place Dining facility.[100][101] The southern edge hosts on-campus fraternity and sorority houses.[102] Nearby is the Kreischer Quadrangle and the Alumni Mall.[103][104] Kreischer quadrangle contains four connected halls, Ashley, Batchelder, Compton, and Darrow, that operate as separate units.[105] Kreischer features a late night dining hall called The Sundial as well as an convenience store in Kreischer-Ashley.[106] Kreischer-Compton is home to the Arts Village Learning Community, for students with interests in dance, art, creative writing, theater, or music.[107] This community offers members-only classes.[107] Arts facilities[edit] Jerome Library on BGSU's main Campus Arts programs are located to the east of Anderson Arena and Jerome Library in the east-central area. The Fine Arts Center is home to the School of Art and houses classrooms, a studio, workshop spaces, art galleries, a glassblowing studio and faculty offices. BGSU is one of only a few schools that offer degrees in glassblowing. The Moore Musical Arts Center is located along Ridge St and is the home to the College of Musical Arts. Moore includes classrooms, recording studios, rehearsal halls, and Kobacker Hall, a large theater where many performances on campus are held.[108] Moore also includes MidAmerican Center for Contemporary Music, a national center with a focus on the study, performance, creative work and promotion of contemporary music.[109] The Wolfe Center for the Arts opened in December 2011.[110] It is the new centerpiece for the Arts, located between Fine Arts and Moore. The 93,000 sq ft (9,000 m2) building houses the School of Art, the Department of Theatre and Film, and the School of Musical Arts.[70] It includes classrooms, rehearsal space, performance/theater space, as well as design and office space, the 400-seat Thomas and Kathleen Donnell Theatre,[111] and a black-box stage, editing and digital laboratories, classrooms, studios, faculty space, and choral rehearsal rooms.[70][112] Athletic and recreation facilities[edit] Interior of the Stroh Center prior to an exhibition game against Tiffin. Most athletic and recreation facilities are located on the eastern half of campus. The Student Recreation Center is a 185,000 sq ft (17,000 m2) facility that includes two swimming pools, four weight rooms, a cardio room, an elevated running track, an Activity Center for aerobics and a large sports center which accommodates basketball, tennis, volleyball, and badminton and other sports.[113] North of the center lies Perry Field House, a 127,000 sq ft (12,000 m2) athletic facility with a 100 x 60 indoor synthetic turf, four batting cages, and a 200-meter track encircling four courts for basketball, volleyball, or tennis.[114] The Slater Family Ice Arena is a 5,000-seat ice hockey arena that is used by various teams and clubs as well as public use. The rink is also home to the Black Swamp Ice Frogs, a special needs hockey team.[115] The arena also includes a smaller ice sheet for curling, figure skating, youth ice hockey, and public skating.[116] The Eppler complex is the oldest building on campus for athletics and is the main practice area for cheerleading, gymnastics, dancing and fencing. At one time it housed the original natatorium.[117] Doyt Perry Stadium is a 28,600 seat football stadium located on the eastern edge.[118] The Stroh Center is an on-campus venue for athletics, concerts, commencement, lectures, and numerous campus and community events. The facility serves as the home for the Falcons men's and women's basketball and volleyball programs. Notably, the structure is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings on campus, designed to achieve challenging Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.[119] There is also the Poe Ditch Rugby field on the north side of campus on Poe Road. BGSU was also home to Forrest Creason Golf Course located to the north of Doyt Perry Stadium until the course closed in 2017.[120] Transportation and safety[edit] BGSU shuttle near the Visitor Center stop. The campus fare-free bus transit system began in 1990 and runs throughout the campus and surrounding neighborhoods.[121] In 2005 the university started testing Hybrid buses on the service's main route.[122] The first hybrid bus on the system used a proprietary diesel-electric propulsion system, known as a Hybrid Booster Drive (HBD), and was developed by the Electric Vehicle Institute (EVI) within the BGSU College of Technology.[122] The system is made up of four routes.[123][124] It includes major stops at various residence halls, academic buildings and athletic buildings.[124] The campus has a mobile application that allows the students to track the location of the different buses around campus. This application also gives an estimated time of arrival for each route to reach a given bus stop.[125] The Orange Bike program began in 2008 as part of an increase in campus sustainability. The program offers a community bike rental service to students to reduce the carbon footprint of commuters.[126] In February of 2020, the university began testing robots from Starship Technologies for on campus deliveries.[127][128] The University Police Department provides 24-hour law enforcement and security, campus escort service, motorist assistance, educational programs, and crime prevention information for the BGSU campus and surrounding areas.[129] The department is staffed by 24 full-time, state-certified police officers granted full police authority by the Ohio Revised Code.[129][130] In addition to the officers, the department includes a student safety services staff that provides services for the university community, such as crowd control and the campus escort service.
