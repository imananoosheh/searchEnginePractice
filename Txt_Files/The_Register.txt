The Register carries syndicated content including Simon Travaglia's BOFH stories.[6] In 2010 The Register supported the successful launch of the Paper Aircraft Released Into Space, a project they announced in 2009 that released a paper plane in the extreme upper atmosphere.[7] Editorial staffers include Andrew Orlowski, Paul Kunert, Gavin Clarke, Joe Fay, Chris Williams (San Francisco bureau), Iain Thomson and Simon Sharwood (Sydney office).

The Guardian also poked fun at their seemingly random use of capitalized words.[19] References[edit] ^ "Theregister.co.uk Site Info". Alexa Internet. Archived from the original on 30 September 2011.
