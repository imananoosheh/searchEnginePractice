Vietnamese Wikipedia Type of site Internet encyclopedia project Available in Vietnamese Headquarters Miami, Florida Owner Wikimedia Foundation URL vi.wikipedia.org Commercial No Registration Optional Launched November 2002; 17 years ago (2002-11) The Vietnamese Wikipedia (Vietnamese: Wikipedia ti?ng Vi?t) is the Vietnamese-language edition of Wikipedia, a free, publicly editable, online encyclopedia supported by the Wikimedia Foundation. As with other language editions of Wikipedia, the project's content is both created and accessed using the MediaWiki wiki software. The Vietnamese Wikipedia's primary competitor is the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Vietnam (T? ?i?n Bách khoa toàn th? Vi?t Nam), a state-funded encyclopedic dictionary also available online. Contents 1 Content 2 History 3 Software 4 Characteristics 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Content[edit] As of March 2020, it has about 1,242,000 articles.[1] It is the largest Wikipedia in a non-European language, as well as the largest for a language which is official in only one country. However, it has only 375,000 articles manually created, 67% of its articles having been made by bots, and thus ranks 3rd among non-European language Wikipedias after the Japanese and Chinese ones.[2] History[edit] The Vietnamese Wikipedia initially went online in November 2002, with a front page and an article about the Internet Society. The project received little attention and did not begin to receive significant contributions until it was "restarted" in October 2003[3] and the newer, Unicode-capable MediaWiki software was installed soon after. By August 2008, the Vietnamese Wikipedia had grown to more than 50,000 articles – a milestone it achieved on August 26 – approximately 432 of which were created by bots.[4] By the time the project reached the 100,000-article milestone on September 12, 2009, bot-generated articles made up around 5% of its corpus.[5] Short articles are designated "stubs"; such articles number in the tens of thousands and include most of the bot-generated articles.[6] An experimental Wikipedia edition in the obsolete ch? Nôm script began in October 2006 at the Wikimedia Incubator.[7] It was deleted in April 2010.[8] An unrelated wiki encyclopedia project, VinaWiki, transliterates Vietnamese Wikipedia articles into ch? Nôm as part of a project to revive the script.[9] The volunteer-led Vietnam Wikimedians User Group supports the development of the Vietnamese Wikipedia and other Vietnamese-language Wikimedia projects. It gained formal recognition as a Wikimedia user group on 28 August 2018.[10] Milestone logos Vietnamese Wikipedia's 10,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 30,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 50,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 75,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 100,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 200,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 250,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 500,000 article logo (28 September 2012) Vietnamese Wikipedia's 750,000 article logo Vietnamese Wikipedia's 1,000,000 article logo (15 June 2014) The Vietnamese Wikipedia's article count reached 500,000 on 28 September 2012 and 1,000,000 on 15 June 2014. Software[edit] The Vietnamese Wikipedia uses AVIM, a JavaScript-based input method that allows the user to type accented Vietnamese text in popular input methods, such as Telex, VNI and VIQR. (See Vietnamese language and computers.) The preferred input system can be selected using a box under the sidebar.[11] Characteristics[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2018) The Vietnamese edition of the failed English Wikipedia proposal on importance is a formal guideline. In 2019 the Vietnamese Wikipedia has 277 thousand unique categories and 36.53% of them do not have appropriate page in the category namespace. The average article in this language version has 6 categories, while number of unique categories per articles ratio is 0.23. The largest number of articles has Technology (66%) and Life (12%) category. In Vietnamese Wikipedia articles related to Sports and Events has the highest average quality. Content about Law is read more often and articles in Organizations category have the highest authors' interest on average.[12] See also[edit] Vietnamese encyclopedias References[edit] ^ "Vietnamese Wikipedia" (in Vietnamese). vi.wikipedia.org. 2014-07-28.
