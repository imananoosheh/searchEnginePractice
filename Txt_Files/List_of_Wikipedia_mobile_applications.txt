List of Wikipedia mobile applications - Wikipedia List of Wikipedia mobile applications From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikimedia's official apps for Wikipedia Wikipedia Developer(s) Wikimedia Foundation Repository github.com/wikimedia Written in Various Website github.com/wikimedia A number of organizations within the Wikimedia movement including the Wikimedia Foundation publish official mobile apps for using Wikipedia on mobile device operating systems. All are available for free via the appropriate app store (e.g. Google Play, App Store, Windows Store). They can also be downloaded independently of any third party store, from the Wikimedia Foundation's releases website, which also keeps old and beta versions.[1] Independent developers have also released many unofficial apps for reading Wikipedia articles. Some apps load content from the Wikipedia site and process it; other apps use the MediaWiki API. Some only display Wikipedia content, usually omitting some features such as categories and talk pages. Some allow editing.

Android The Android app allows editing articles directly from the app. It has limited capability to show categories and talk pages. It is also available on F-Droid.[2] iOS The iOS app also provides a read and write version of Wikipedia,[3] similar to the mobile web version. It allows users to share an article via Facebook and other social websites. It also allows users to find geotagged articles near their current location. It does not allow to see categories or talk pages, nor to see the normal desktop version. Windows The Metro-style app provides a read-only version of Wikipedia, similar to the mobile web version. The app when used in Windows RT is incapable of showing moving pictures. Wikimedia Switzerland Wikimedia CH, the Swiss chapter of the Wikimedia movement, has developed a number of offline apps based on Wikipedia content.
