Founded by DoubleClick's former CEO Kevin P. Ryan, Dwight Merriman, and Henry Blodget,[3] the site began as a consolidation of industry vertical blogs, the first of them being Silicon Alley Insider (began May 16, 2007) and Clusterstock (started March 20, 2008).[4] In addition to providing and analyzing business news, the site aggregates news stories on various subjects from around the web. It reported a profit for the first time ever in the 4th quarter of 2010.[5] In June 2012, it had 5.4 million unique visitors.[6] In 2015 Axel Springer SE acquired 88% of the stake in Business Insider Inc. for $343 million (€306 million).[7] Business Insider also hosts industry conferences, such as IGNITION,[8] which explores the emerging business models of digital media. In January 2015, Business Insider launched BI Intelligence,[9] a subscription-based research service that provides data and analysis on the mobile, payments, eCommerce, social, and digital media industries. The site publishes numerous annual editorial franchises, such as the "Digital 100: The World's Most Valuable Private Tech Companies."[10] Tech Insider[edit] In July 2015, Business Insider began the technology website Tech Insider, with a staff of 40 people working primarily from the company's existing New York headquarters, but originally separated from the main Business Insider newsroom.[11] However, Tech Insider was eventually folded into the Business Insider website.[12] Markets Insider[edit] In October, 2016,[13] Business Insider started Markets Insider as a joint venture with Finanzen.net, another Axel Springer company. The markets data site covers stocks and the macro economy, as well as other financial assets.[citation needed] BI Sub-Saharan Africa[edit] In January 2017, Business Insider announced that it would be launching a new Sub-Saharan site in partnership with Ringier Africa Digital Publishing.[14][15] Henry Blodget—co-founder, CEO, and global Editor-in-Chief of Business Insider—said of the partnership, "Ringier ... is the ideal partner to help us bring to sub-saharan Africa [our] unique voice and attitude."[16] Former Ventures Africa journalist David Adeleke is the editor for Business Insider SSA.[citation needed] Reception[edit] In January 2009, the Clusterstock section appeared in Time's "Best 25 Financial Blogs",[17] and the Silicon Alley Insider section was listed in PC Magazine's "Our Favorite Blogs 2009."[18] 2009 also saw Business Insider's selection as an official Webby honoree for Best Business Blog.[19] In 2012, Business Insider was named to the Inc. 500. In 2013, the publication was once again nominated in the Blog-Business category at the Webby Awards.[20] In January 2014, The New York Times reported that Business Insider's web traffic was comparable to that of The Wall Street Journal.[21] In 2017, Digiday included imprint Insider as a candidate in two separate categories—"Best New Vertical" and "Best Use of Instagram"—at their annual Publishing Awards.[22] The website has, however, faced criticism for what critics consider its clickbait-style headlines.[23][24][25] In 2013, The New Yorker criticized the website for prioritizing publishing speed over accuracy.[26] In 2018, the website received criticism from some media outlets after deleting a controversial column about Scarlett Johansson.[27][28] References[edit] ^ "Businessinsider.com Site Info".
