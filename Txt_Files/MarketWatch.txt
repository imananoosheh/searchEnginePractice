After pricing at $17 per share, the stock traded as high as $130 per share on its first day of trading, giving it a market capitalization of over $1 billion despite only $7 million in annual revenues.[3] In June 2000, the company formed a joint venture with the Financial Times[7] with Peter Bale as managing editor.[8] In January 2004, Calandra resigned amidst allegations of insider trading.[5] In January 2005, Dow Jones & Company acquired the company for $528 million, or $18 per share.[9] See also[edit] List of assets owned by News Corp References[edit] ^ Adinolfi, Joseph (May 14, 2014).
