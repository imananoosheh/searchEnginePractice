Peer-to-peer carsharing (also known as person-to-person carsharing and peer-to-peer car rental) is the process whereby existing car owners make their vehicles available for others to rent for short periods of time.

These include California, Oregon, Washington, Maryland,[14] and Colorado.[15] Prohibitions[edit] In the U.S., New York is the only state that does not allow peer-to-peer car rental because the owner cannot exclude him or herself from liability to a renter.[citation needed] Ecological impact[edit] Peer-to-peer car sharing has the potential to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and lower pollution levels.[16] See also[edit] Carsharing Car pooling Collaborative consumption Person-to-person lending Sharing economy Shared transport Sustainable transportation Peer-to-peer renting Notes and references[edit] ^ Fishman, Elliot, ed.
