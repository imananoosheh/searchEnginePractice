It covers the field of American history and was established in 1914 as the Mississippi Valley Historical Review, the official journal of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association. After the publication of its fiftieth volume, the recognition of a shift in the direction of the membership and its scholarship led to the name change in 1964. The journal is headquartered in Bloomington, Indiana, where it has close ties to the History Department at Indiana University. It is published quarterly, in March, June, September, and December.
