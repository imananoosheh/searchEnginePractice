(February 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A gripe site is a type of website that is dedicated to criticism of or complaint about a certain individual, sometimes constructive and other times for the purpose of lampooning the target. That targeted individual could be a person, place, politician, corporation, institution, or something else. These are often created by less affluent people to target powerful people or groups because space is cheap on the Internet. In an attempt to shut down a gripe site, companies have sued the gripe site owner alleging defamation, trademark infringement, trademark dilution, libel, and copyright infringement.[citation needed] See also[edit] royaldutchshellplc.com References[edit] Rise of the gripe site Prospect magazine, February 2007 External links[edit] cybergriping.com webgripesites.com weeklygripe.co.uk gripes.com.au v t e Intellectual property activism Issues Artificial scarcity Copyright infringement Copyright troll Digital rights management Gripe site Legal aspects of file sharing Mashup digital music videos Monopolies of knowledge Music piracy Orphan works Patents biological software software patent debate trolling Public domain Concepts All rights reversed Alternative compensation system Anti-copyright notice Business models for open-source software Copyleft Commercial use of copyleft works Commons-based peer production Electronic sell-through Free content Free software license Libertarian positions Open content Open-design movement Open Music Model Open patent Open-source Open-source hardware Open-source software Prize system contests Share-alike Video on demand Movements Access to Knowledge movement Anti-copyright Cultural environmentalism Free-culture movement Free software movement Organizations Pro-copyright Copyright Alliance Pro-copyleft Creative Commons Electronic Frontier Foundation Free Software Foundation Open Rights Group Organization for Transformative Works The Pirate Bay Piratbyrån Pirate Party Public Knowledge Sci-Hub Students for Free Culture People Cory Doctorow Alexandra Elbakyan Rick Falkvinge Lawrence Lessig Richard Stallman Peter Suber Peter Sunde Aaron Swartz Documentaries Steal This Film (2006, 2007) Good Copy Bad Copy (2007) RiP!: A Remix Manifesto (2008) TPB AFK: The Pirate Bay Away From Keyboard (2013) The Internet's Own Boy (2014) v t e Website topics By type Audition website Cashback website Fansite Gripe site Health website Lab website Library website Microsite Minisite Mirror site Nanosite Personal wedding website School website Lists by type Academic databases BitTorrent sites Blogs Chat websites Dating websites Deal of the day services Dictionaries Employment websites Encyclopedias Fake news websites Image-sharing websites Internet forums Marketplaces Microcredit lending websites Online databases Q&A sites Satirical news websites Search engines Social bookmarking websites Social networking websites defunct Tor hidden services Video hosting services Virtual communities Web directories Webcomics Wikis Lists by subject Astronomy websites Biodiversity databases Biology websites Educational websites Environmental websites Food and drink websites Video game websites Professional wrestling websites Other Founded before 1995 Most popular websites Websites blocked in mainland China Websites blocked in Russia Websites blocked in the United Kingdom Websites with country access restrictions Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gripe_site&oldid=932319481" Categories: Consumer protection Websites Hidden categories: Articles needing additional references from August 2012 All articles needing additional references Articles lacking in-text citations from February 2011 All articles lacking in-text citations All articles with unsourced statements Articles with unsourced statements from August 2010 Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item Cite this page Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages Polski ?????? / srpski Edit links This page was last edited on 25 December 2019, at 00:36 (UTC).
