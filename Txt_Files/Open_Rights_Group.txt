The pledge reached 1000 people on 29 November 2005.[2][3] The Open Rights Group was launched at a "sell-out" meeting in Soho, London.[4][5] Work[edit] The group has made submissions to the All Party Internet Group (APIG) inquiry into digital rights management[6][7] and the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property.[8][9] The group was honoured in the 2008 Privacy International Big Brother Awards alongside No2ID, Liberty, Genewatch UK and others, as a recognition of their efforts to keep state and corporate mass surveillance at bay.[10] In 2010 the group worked with 38 Degrees[11] to oppose the introduction of the Digital Economy Act, which was passed in April 2010.[12] Goals[edit] To collaborate with other digital rights and related organisations. To nurture a community of campaigning volunteers, from grassroots activists to technical and legal experts. To preserve and extend traditional civil liberties in the digital world. To provide a media clearinghouse, connecting journalists with experts and activists. To raise awareness in the media of digital rights abuses. Areas of interest[edit] Play media Cory Doctorow talks at ORGCon 2012 about the UK Government's Communications Data Bill 2012 The organisation, though focused on the impact of digital technology on the liberty of UK citizens, operates with an apparently wide range of interests within that category. Its interests include:[13][14] Access to knowledge[edit] Copyright Creative Commons Free and open source software The public domain Crown copyright Digital Restrictions Management Software patents Free speech and censorship[edit] Internet filtering Right to parody s. 127 Communications Act 2003 Government and democracy[edit] Electronic voting Freedom of information legislation Privacy, surveillance and censorship[edit] Automatic Vehicle Tracking Communications data retention Identity management Net Neutrality NHS patients’ medical database Police DNA Records RFID Structure[edit] ORG has a paid staff,[15] whose members include: Jim Killock (Executive Director) Javier Ruiz Diaz (Campaigner) Former staff include Suw Charman-Anderson and Becky Hogge, both Executive Directors, e-voting coordinator Jason Kitcat, campaigner Peter Bradwell, grassroots campaigner Katie Sutton and administrator Katerina Maniadaki.[16] The group's patron is Neil Gaiman.[17] As of February 2011 they have 22,000 supporters of which 1,400 are paying contributors[18] Advisory council and board of directors[edit] In addition to staff members and volunteers, there is an advisory panel of over thirty members, and a Board of Directors, which oversees the group's work, staff, fundraising and policy.[19] The current board members are: Owen Blacker James Cronin Azmina Dhrodia John Elliott Tom de Grunwald Hannah Little Alec Muffett Brian Parkinson Simon Phipps Christi Scarborough In January 2015, the Open Rights Group announced the formation of a Scottish Advisory Council which will be handling matters relating to Scottish digital rights and campaigns.

ORGCON[edit] ORGCON was the first ever conference dedicated to digital rights in the UK,[20] marketed as "a crash course in digital rights". It was held for the first time in 2010 at City University in London and included keynote talks from Cory Doctorow, politicians and similar pressure groups including Liberty, NO2ID and Big Brother Watch. ORGCON has since been held in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2019 where the keynote was given by Edward Snowden.
