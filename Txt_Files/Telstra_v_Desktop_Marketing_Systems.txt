Contents 1 Decision 2 Appeal to the Full Court 3 Subsequent consideration 4 References Decision[edit] In his decision handed down on 25 May 2001, Justice Finkelstein found that the contents of that product, which allowed the user to perform reverse telephone searches by service number, was almost identical in content to the publicly listed directories, even if some of the content was listed in a different fashion. The court found that Telstra, the Australian owner/publisher of the White Pages and Yellow Pages telephone directories, had copyright in the content of those directories. Consequently, the use of the data by the Respondents constituted copyright infringement, and the product was removed from sale. Furthermore, as a result of this decision, a similar web-based directory called "Blackpages", published by 2600 Australia, also terminated its service. Appeal to the Full Court[edit] The Full Court of the Federal Court rejected an appeal by Desktop Marketing Systems, followed the UK approach in Walter v Lane,[2] with emphasis on the effort and expense incurred by Telstra in collecting the data.[3] Subsequent consideration[edit] On 8 February 2010, the decision was overturned in a ruling by Justice Gordon by Telstra v Phone Directories,[4] following the decision of the High Court in IceTV v Nine Network.[5] The ruling stated that copyright was not applicable to these works as Telstra conceded that there was no identifiable author contributing to the publication, even considering third parties, and hence did not represent a sufficient literary effort to warrant protection. Further considerations were raised regarding the level of collaboration required between staff members to warrant the concept of joint authorship, as well as the level of intellectual effort required to arrange and organise the listings. Subsequently, none of the works were established as "original works", noting that there should exist a correlative relationship between originality and authorship.
