Jolevski North Macedonia portal Other countries v t e North Macedonia is a member state of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In 1995, the country joined the Partnership for Peace. It then began taking part in various NATO missions, including the International Security Assistance Force and the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Greece vetoed the country's invitation to join; however, NATO member states agreed that the country would receive an invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute.[2] Following an agreement in June 2018 to rename the country, representatives of NATO member states signed a protocol on the accession of North Macedonia to NATO on 6 February 2019.[3] Over the next thirteen months, all of NATO's 29 member states ratified the protocol. The accession protocol entered into force on 19 March 2020, allowing North Macedonia to deposit its instrument of accession and thereby become a member state of NATO, doing so on 27 March 2020.

At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Greece vetoed the Republic of Macedonia's invitation to join, however, NATO nations agreed that the country would receive an invitation upon resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute.[2] Greece felt that its neighbour's constitutional name implies territorial aspirations against its own region of Macedonia. After the veto, Greece was sued in the International Court of Justice, over the use of "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" as an acceptable option with which to enter NATO, while Greece counterargued that it was a collective decision of NATO not to invite the Republic of Macedonia, and therefore the interim accord signed between the two countries was not violated. Greece also considered blocking the Republic of Macedonia's accession to the European Union over the naming dispute.[4] Former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked the Republic of Macedonia and Greece to find an "acceptable solution" to the dispute, so that the Republic of Macedonia would be free to join NATO.[5] In 2014, prior to the 65th anniversary of its founding, NATO announced that it would not be offering any new countries membership in the organisation that year. Some analysts, such as Jorge Benitez of the Atlantic Council think tank, argued that this reluctance was partly due to the new security climate after Russia's annexation of Crimea.[6] There has been continued debate about how Russia will view the republic's accession.[7] Following an agreement in June 2018 to rename the country the Republic of North Macedonia, NATO agreed to consider extending an invitation to the country to join at its summit on 11–12 July.[8] On 11 July 2018, NATO invited the republic to begin membership talks, saying the country could join the organisation once the naming issue was resolved.[9] Formal accession talks began on 18 October 2018.[10] On 6 February 2019, the permanent representatives to NATO of the member states signed a protocol on the accession of North Macedonia to NATO.[3] Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, alongside NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, in Skopje on 3 June 2019, said that he expected the ratification process to be finalised by the end of October.[11] However, as of December, the accession protocol has not been finalised, though NATO reassured North Macedonia that the ratification process is "well on track".[12] By that time North Macedonia was expected to join NATO in early 2020, with the alliance publicly reassuring the country its accession would go ahead.[13] North Macedonia was given a seat at the 2019 London summit alongside other NATO members and was represented by a delegation headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.[14] On 11 February 2020, the Macedonian Sobranie unanimously approved the North Atlantic Treaty, with 114 votes in favour, no abstentions and no opposition.[15][16][17] Due to its political crisis, Spain was the last country to ratify the accession protocol, which it did in March 2020.[17][14] North Macedonia subsequently signed the instrument of accession and eventually became a member state on 27 March 2020.[18][19][20] Accession[edit] Negotiation progress[edit] Event Date

ratification, but the Ponsonby Rule is that they are laid before Parliament with an explanatory memorandum.[86] The treaty was laid before parliament on 27 June 2019, and the last day a negative resolution could be passed was 16 October 2019. Public opinion[edit] Anti-NATO graffiti in Ohrid in July 2018, translating to "NATO are killers. I am for the salvation of Macedonia. #Boycott." During the Kosovo War of 1999, the Macedonian government maintained a pro-NATO position.[91] A majority of the population of the Republic of Macedonia criticised the government stance and opposed NATO intervention in Kosovo due to fears over irredentism from ethnic Albanians within the country, the unstable economy, disruption of trade brought about by war, and Slavic solidarity with Serbs.[92] Prime Minister Ljub?o Georgievski stated during the war that anti-NATO sentiment was the "second biggest threat" to the country after the arrival of Albanian refugees from Kosovo.[93] The country's Albanian population supported NATO and its intervention to assist the Albanians of Kosovo.[91] In 2008, a poll following the NATO summit showed that 82.5% of ethnic Macedonian citizens opposed changing their country's constitutional name in order to join NATO.[94] NATO membership in general in 2008 was supported by 85.2% of the population.[95] Elections were called following the 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the center-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that attracted criticism from NATO members.[96] In a statewide 2010 survey, 80.02% of respondents said they would vote for the Republic of Macedonia to become part of NATO if a referendum on accession were to take place.[97] In another survey, some 65% of ethnic Macedonians expressed that they opposed a name change of the state as being the price for NATO membership.[97] In a 2016 poll, some 68% of ethnic Macedonians supported joining NATO, possibly under the FYROM name.[98] Albanians of North Macedonia harbour strongly pro-NATO sentiments.[99] See also[edit] Accession of North Macedonia to the European Union Enlargement of NATO Foreign relations of North Macedonia Macedonia naming dispute References[edit] ^ "Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty on the Accession of the Republic of North Macedonia" (PDF).
