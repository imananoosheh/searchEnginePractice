Armee / Armeeoberkommando 2 / A.O.K. 2) was an army level command of the German Army in World War I. It was formed on mobilization in August 1914 from the III Army Inspection.[1] The army was disbanded in 1919 during demobilization after the war.[2] Contents 1 History 1.1 Order of Battle, 30 October 1918 2 Commanders 3 Glossary 4 See also 5 References 6 Bibliography History[edit] The 2nd Army during World War I, fought on the Western Front and took part in the Schlieffen Plan offensive against France and Belgium in August 1914. Commanded by General Karl von Bülow, the 2nd Army's mission was to support the 1st Army's sweep around the left flank of the French Army and encircle Paris, bringing a rapid conclusion to the war. The 2nd Army laid siege to, and took the Belgian fortresses around Namur, and fought General Charles Lanrezac's French 5th Army at the Battle of Charleroi on 23–24 August 1914 and again at St. Quentin on 29–30 August 1914. 2nd Army bore the brunt of the Allied attack in the Battle of the Somme. It had grown to such an extent that a decision was made to split it into two still-powerful armies. Therefore, 1st Army was reformed on 19 July 1916 from the right (northern) wing of the 2nd Army. The former commander of 2nd Army, General der Infanterie Fritz von Below, took command of 1st Army and 2nd Army got a new commander General der Artillerie Max von Gallwitz. Von Gallwitz was also installed as commander of Heeresgruppe Gallwitz – Somme to co-ordinate the actions of both armies on the Somme.[3] A large proportion of the Army would be wiped out during the joint Anglo-French offensive on the Somme. At the end of the war it was serving as part of Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht.[4] Order of Battle, 30 October 1918[edit] By the end of the war, the 2nd Army was organised as: Organization of 2nd Army on 30 October 1918[5] Army Corps Division 2nd Army 54th Corps (z.b.V.) 21st Reserve Division 22nd Division 4th Division 113th Division 239th Division 12th Reserve Division Jäger Division 185th Division IV Reserve Corps 14th Division 58th Division 18th Reserve Division 30th Division 44th Reserve Division 51st Corps (z.b.V.) 2nd Cyclist Brigade 243rd Division 121st Division 54th Division 1st Guards Reserve Division 22nd Reserve Division Under Army command 17th Reserve Division Commanders[edit] The 2nd Army had the following commanders during its existence.[6] 2nd Army From Commander Previously Subsequently, 2 August 1914 Generaloberst Karl von Bülow III Army Inspectorate (III.
