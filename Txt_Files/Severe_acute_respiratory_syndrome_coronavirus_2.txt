Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[9] Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 2 metres (6.6 ft).[24][25] Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another possible cause of infection.[26] Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;[27] the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilizes its lipid bilayer.[28][29] Viral RNA has also been found in stool samples from infected people.[30] Whether the virus is infectious during the incubation period is uncertain.[31] On 1 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that "transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission".[32] However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the outbreak in China suggested that "pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections" and that subclinical infections may have been the source of a majority of infections.[33] Reservoir The first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in Wuhan, China.[10] The original source of viral transmission to humans and when the strain became pathogenic remains unclear.[34][35][36] Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market,[37][38] it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.[36][39] However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.[34][40] Research into the natural reservoir of the virus strain that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak has resulted in the discovery of many SARS-like bat coronaviruses, most originating in the Rhinolophus genus of horseshoe bats, and two viral nucleic acid sequences found in samples taken from Rhinolophus sinicus show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.[12][41][42] A third viral nucleic acid sequence from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.[10][43] The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,[44] but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.[39] A metagenomic study published in 2019 previously revealed that SARS-CoV, the strain of the virus that causes SARS, was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of Sunda pangolins.[45] On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from Guangzhou had discovered a pangolin sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence "99% identical" to SARS-CoV-2.[46] When released, the results clarified that "the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference."[47] Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their poaching and trading for use in traditional Chinese medicine remains common.[48][49] Microbiologists and geneticists in Texas have independently found evidence of reassortment in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.[50] However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.[51] This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002–2004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known civet coronavirus.[39] Phylogenetics and taxonomy Genomic information Genomic organisation of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, the earliest sequenced sample of SARS-CoV-2 NCBI genome ID MN908947 Genome size 29,903 bases Year of completion 2020 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV.[52] Like the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B).[53][54][55] Its RNA sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length.[7] SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses.[36][56][57] With a sufficient number of sequenced genomes, it is possible to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) and other institutions;[7][58] the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.[59] A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were "highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.[59] As of 13 March 2020,[update] 410 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on five continents were publicly available.[60] On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five conserved sequences of nucleic acids, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak were insufficient to make them separate viral species. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus.[1] Structural biology Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion Each SARS-CoV-2 virion is approximately 50–200 nanometres in diameter.[61] Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the viral envelope.[62] The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using cryogenic electron microscopy,[63][64] is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to the membrane of a host cell.[62] SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted; ACE2 binding domain in magenta Protein modeling experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of cell entry.[65] By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using reverse genetics methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.[10][66][67][68][69][70] Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.[63] SARS-CoV-2 may also use basigin to gain cell entry.[71] Digitally colourised electron micrographs of SARS-CoV-2 (yellow) emerging from human cells cultured in a laboratory Initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.[72] After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's protease TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a fusion peptide. The virion then releases RNA into the cell, forcing the cell to produce copies of the virus that are disseminated to infect more cells.[73][better source needed] SARS-CoV-2 produces at least three virulence factors that promote shedding of new virions from host cells and inhibit immune response.[62] Epidemiology Main articles: 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19 testing Micrograph of SARS-CoV-2 virions (red) isolated from a patient during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic Based upon the low variability exhibited among known SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, the strain is thought to have been detected by health authorities within weeks of its emergence among the human population in late 2019.[34][74] The earliest case of infection currently known is thought to have been found on 17 November 2019.[75] The virus subsequently spread to all provinces of China and to more than one hundred other countries in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania.[76] Human-to-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed in all of these regions.[9][77][78][79][80][81] On 30 January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO,[8][82] and on 11 March 2020 the WHO declared it a pandemic.[83][84] As of 27 March 2020 (20:00 UTC), there were 585,040edit confirmed cases of infection, of which over 80,000 were in mainland China.[76] While the proportion of infections that result in confirmed infection or progress to diagnosable disease remains unclear,[85] one mathematical model estimated the number of people infected in Wuhan alone at 75,815 as of 25 January 2020, at a time when confirmed infections were far lower.[86] The total number of deaths attributed to the virus was 26,819edit as of 27 March 2020 (20:00 UTC); 129,812 people had recovered from infection by that time.[76] Less than a sixth of all deaths have occurred in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.[76] Before 24 February 2020, the proportion was over 95%.[87][88] The basic reproduction number ( R 0 {\displaystyle R_{0}} ) of the virus has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 3.9.[89][90] This means that each infection from the virus is expected to result in 1.4 to 3.9 new infections when no members of the community are immune and no preventive measures are taken.
