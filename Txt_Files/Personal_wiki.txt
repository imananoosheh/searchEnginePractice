Personal wiki software can be broadly divided into two categories: Multi-user applications with personal editions (such as MoinMoin or TWiki), installed for standalone use and inaccessible to outside users, which may require additional software such as a web server, database management system and/or WAMP/LAMP bundle[1] Applications designed for single users, not dependent on a database engine or web server Some personal wikis are public, but password-protected, and run on dedicated web servers or are hosted by third parties.
