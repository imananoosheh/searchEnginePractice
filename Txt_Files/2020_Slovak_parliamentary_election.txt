Prime Minister before election Peter Pellegrini Smer–SD Prime Minister Igor Matovi? O?aNO Parliamentary elections were held in Slovakia on 29 February 2020. All 150 members of the National Council were elected and the leader of the resultant government party or coalition will become the Prime Minister. The ruling coalition comprising Direction – Social Democracy (Smer–SD), the Slovak National Party and Most–Híd led by Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini of Smer–SD was defeated by the anti-corruption party Ordinary People led by Igor Matovi?. However, as no single party or electoral coalition attained an absolute majority of seats, a post-election coalition was required to form a government.[1][2][3][4] It was the first time since the 2006 election that Smer–SD did not emerge as the party with the most seats in the National Council. On 13 March, Matovi? announced he had reached an agreement for a governing coalition with We Are Family, Freedom and Solidarity and For the People, though they had not agreed upon a common governing program.

Incumbent prime minister Robert Fico remained in office[5] until 2018 when Peter Pellegrini took over. The 2019 European Parliament election in Slovakia[6] took place on 25 May 2019. Electoral system[edit] The 150 members of the National Council will be elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency with an electoral threshold of 5% for single parties, and 7% for coalition groupings with at least two parties. The elections use the open list system, with seats allocated using the Hagenbach-Bischoff system. Voters will be able to cast up to four preferential votes for candidates on the list of the party they voted for.[7] All participating parties must register 90 days before election day and pay a deposit of €17,000, which will be refunded to all parties gaining 3% or more of the vote. All Slovak citizens are allowed to vote except for convicted felons in prison (only those who were convicted for serious offences), people declared ineligible to perform legal acts by court and citizens under 18 years of age. All citizens, who are 21 years of age or older and are permanent residents of Slovakia, are allowed to run as candidates except for prisoners, convicted felons and those declared ineligible to perform legal acts by court.[8] Voters not present in their electoral district at the time of the elections are allowed to request a voting certificate (voli?ský preukaz), which allows them to vote in any district regardless of their residency.[9] Voters abroad on election day are allowed to request a postal vote.[10] According to the Central Election Committee approx. 20,000 Slovak citizens abroad have requested a postal vote during the last election. The deadline for requests passed on 10 January 2020. Leadership changes[edit] The Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) and Party of the Hungarian Community (SMK-MKP) were two parties which couldn't pass the 5 percent threshold to the parliament in 2016 but further gained more than 4% (KDH got 4,9 percent, while SMK-MKP got 4,1 percent). KDH lost all of its 16 seats while SMK-MKP haven't gained any. Leader of the KDH, Ján Fige?, announced his resignation few days after 2016 election. He was then replaced by Alojz Hlina on 11 June 2016.[11] Leadership of the SMK-MKP, which was led by József Berényi, was taken over by József Menyhárt on 11 June 2016.[12] On 12 August 2016, incumbent leader of coalition party Network (SIE?), Radoslav Procházka, announced that he had no further intention to lead his party after a disastrous result in the election. A day later on 13 August at the party convention, it was decided that the new leader of the party would be Roman Brecely, his fellow party member and incumbent minister of transportation. He was the only candidate to stand up for the post although he didn't intend to run for the office.[13] On 15 March 2018, Robert Fico announced his resignation as Prime Minister of Slovakia which the President Andrej Kiska accepted. Peter Pellegrini, currently Deputy Prime Minister for Investment & Informatization, has become the new Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic. Fico has remained the leader of Smer–SD, and kept his parliamentary mandate. Pellegrini's cabinet was appointed on 22 March 2018. Opinion polls[edit] Main article: Opinion polling for the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2019) Results[edit] The ruling coalition comprising Direction – Social Democracy (Smer–SD), the Slovak National Party and Most–Híd led by Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini of Smer–SD was defeated by the anti-corruption party Ordinary People led by Igor Matovi?. However, as no single party or electoral coalition attained an absolute majority of seats, a post-election coalition will be required to form a government.[14][15][16][17] It is likely to consist of at least the three centre-right and moderate conservative parties: Ordinary People, Freedom and Solidarity and For the People - which would together hold a total of 78 seats, but may also include the right-wing We Are Family party - which would expand the potential coalition's support to a constitutional majority total of 95 seats.[18] This election was also the first time since the 2006 election that Smer–SD did not emerge as the party with the most seats in the National Council. The coalition of Progressive Slovakia and SPOLU failed to meet the 7% threshold for coalitions to enter parliament by only 926 votes, surprising analysts, as they had been several percentage points above the threshold required in opinion polls as recently as a few days before the election, and polled above the threshold in exit polls taken on election day. The coalition submitted an electoral complaint with the Constitutional Court on 12 March seeking a recount, although they did not have any expectation it would significantly change the results, and only did so in order to clear doubts about the democratic process.[19] Results of the election, showing vote strength for each party by district.
