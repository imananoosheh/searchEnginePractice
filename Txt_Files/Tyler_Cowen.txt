American economist Tyler Cowen Born (1962-01-21) January 21, 1962 (age 58) Bergen County, New Jersey, United States Nationality American Career information Field Cultural economics School or tradition Neoclassical economics Alma mater George Mason University Harvard University (PhD) Doctoral advisor Thomas Schelling Influences Chicago School, Carl Menger, Plato[1] Tyler Cowen (/?ka??n/; born January 21, 1962) is an American economist, who is an economics professor at George Mason University, where he holds the Holbert L. Harris chair in the economics department.[2] He hosts the economics blog Marginal Revolution, together with co-author Alex Tabarrok. Cowen and Tabarrok also maintain the website Marginal Revolution University, a venture in online education. Cowen writes the "Economic Scene" column for The New York Times and since July 2016 has been a regular opinion columnist at Bloomberg Opinion.[3] He also writes for such publications as The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Newsweek and the Wilson Quarterly. He serves as general director of George Mason's Mercatus Center, a university research center that focuses on the market economy. In September, 2018, Tyler and his team at George Mason University launched Emergent Ventures, a grant and fellowship focused on "moon-shot" ideas. [4] He was ranked at number 72 among the "Top 100 Global Thinkers" in 2011 by Foreign Policy Magazine "for finding markets in everything".[5] In a 2011 poll of experts by The Economist, Cowen was included in the top 36 nominations of "which economists were most influential over the past decade".[6] Contents 1 Education and personal life 2 Writings 2.1 Culture 2.2 Books 2.3 The New York Times columns 2.4 Dining guide 3 Political philosophy 4 Criticism 5 Publications 5.1 Books 5.2 Select journal articles 5.3 Select articles 6 References 7 External links Education and personal life[edit] Cowen was raised in Hillsdale, New Jersey.[7] At 15, he became the youngest ever New Jersey state chess champion.[8][9] Cowen is of Irish ancestry.[10] He graduated from George Mason University with a bachelor of science degree in economics in 1983 and received his PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1987 with his thesis titled Essays in the theory of welfare economics. At Harvard, he was mentored by game theorist Thomas Schelling, the 2005 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. He is married to Natasha Cowen (née Miskinyants), a lawyer. Writings[edit] Culture[edit] The Los Angeles Times has described Cowen as "a man who can talk about Haitian voodoo flags, Iranian cinema, Hong Kong cuisine, Abstract Expressionism, Zairian music and Mexican folk art with seemingly equal facility".[11] One of Cowen's primary research interests is the economics of culture. He has written books on fame (What Price Fame?), art (In Praise of Commercial Culture) and cultural trade (Creative Destruction: How Globalization Is Changing the World's Cultures). In Markets and Cultural Voices, he relays how globalization is changing the world of three Mexican amate painters. Cowen argues that free markets change culture for the better, allowing them to evolve into something more people want. Other books include Public Goods and Market Failures, The Theory of Market Failure, Explorations in the New Monetary Economics, Risk and Business Cycles, Economic Welfare and New Theories of Market Failure. Books[edit] Cowen presenting his 2011 book The Great Stagnation The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better (2011) An Economist Gets Lunch: New Rules for Everyday Foodies, "taking on food with equally provocative ideas." New York : Plume, 2013.[12] Create Your Own Economy: The Path to Prosperity in a Disordered World was released in July 2009 (and re-released in 2010, with a new title, The Age of the Infovore: Succeeding in the Information Economy), receiving favorable reviews from critics including Matthew Yglesias and Tim Harford. Average Is Over (2013), on the future of modern economies. The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream, (2017) was endorsed by Malcolm Gladwell.[13] The New York Times columns[edit] Cowen's New York Times columns cover a wide range of issues such as the 2008 financial crisis.[14] Dining guide[edit] His dining guide for the D.C. area, "Tyler Cowen's Ethnic Dining Guide",[15] was reprinted in the Food section of The Washington Post.[citation needed] Political philosophy[edit] Cowen has written papers on political philosophy and ethics. He co-wrote a paper with philosopher Derek Parfit arguing against the social discount rate.[16] In a 2006 paper, he argued that the epistemic problem fails to refute consequentialist forms of argument.[17] Cowen has been described as a "libertarian bargainer" who can influence practical policy making,[18] yet he endorsed bank bailouts in his March 2, 2009 column in The New York Times.[19] In a 2007 article entitled "The Paradox of Libertarianism", Cowen argued that libertarians "should embrace a world with growing wealth, growing positive liberty, and yes, growing government. We don't have to favor the growth in government per se, but we do need to recognize that sometimes it is a package deal".[20] In 2012, David Brooks called Cowen "one of the most influential bloggers on the right", writing that he is among those who "start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way".[21] In an August 2014 blog post, Cowen wrote: "Just to summarize, I generally favor much more immigration but not open borders, I am a liberal on most but not all social issues, and I am market-oriented on economic issues. On most current foreign policy issues I am genuinely agnostic as to what exactly we should do but skeptical that we are doing the right thing at the moment. I don't like voting for either party or for third parties".[22] Cowen has described himself as a liberal on most social issues[23] and supports same-sex marriage.[24] After the Supreme Court issued its holding regarding same-sex marriage, Cowen said that "this is exciting and very positive news. Most of all, it is a breakthrough for those people who can now marry, or exercise the choice not to marry".[25] Cowen is a teetotaler, stating he is "with the Mormons" on alcohol,[26] later stating: "I encourage people to just completely, voluntarily abstain from alcohol and make it a social norm".[27] Criticism[edit] Fellow economists have criticized Cowen's pro-free market views. In his January 23, 2009 blog titled "Dumping on Robert Barro", Cowen challenged those who were advocating at the time more stimulus for the American economy to show him evidence that stimulus works.[28] In response, economist Bill Mitchell pointed out "the Post World War II period up until the mid-1970s".[29] According to William K. Black, associate professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and former bank regulator, Cowen "assumes that productivity determines personal wealth and is measured by wealth", but in reality Cowen's "meritocratic vanguard caused the greatest loss of wealth to society" while "so many financial CEOs not only destroyed societal wealth, but also became wealthy through accounting control fraud".[30] Black also pointed out that Cowen along with what he calls "theoclassical economists" through their ideas have "created such a criminogenic environment that control fraud is frequently the optimal strategy for maximizing the CEOs' self-interest".[31] In another column, Black challenged Cowen's "assumption that unrestrained self-interested actions produce a hyper-meritocracy that improves life", stating instead that "unrestrained self-interested actions are the primary threat to humanity".[32] Publications[edit] Books[edit] Big business: A Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero, New York: St. Martin's Press, 2019.
