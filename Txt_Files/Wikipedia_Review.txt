Wikipedia Review - Wikipedia Wikipedia Review From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia Review The Wikipedia Review logo, which uses a white hat Type of site Internet watchdog, Internet forum and blog Available in English, German Owner Anonymous Revenue Accepts donations URL wikipediareview.com Alexa rank 6,528,339 (July 2018[update])[1] Commercial No Registration Optional (required to post) Launched Original site: November 2005.[2] Current site: February 19, 2006.[3] Wikipedia Review was an Internet forum and blog for the discussion of Wikimedia Foundation projects, in particular the content and conflicts of Wikipedia.[4][5] Wikipedia Review was a Wikipedia watchdog website, scrutinizing Wikipedia and reporting on its flaws.[6] It provided an independent forum to discuss Wikipedia editors and their influence on Wikipedia content. At its peak, participants included current Wikipedia editors, former Wikipedia editors, a few users banned from Wikipedia, and people who had never edited.[7] Upon its demise, many of its users started Wikipediocracy, a similar blog and forum. Contents 1 Background 2 Commentary 3 Content and structure 4 References 5 External links Background[edit] The site was founded in November 2005 by "Igor Alexander", and hosted by ProBoards.[2] On 19 February 2006 it moved to its own domain name using Invision Power Board software.[3][8] The site required registration using a valid e-mail address to post and blacklisted email providers that allowed anonymity so as to discourage the operation of multiple accounts by a single user.[9] Wikipedia Review was cited for its discussion of wiki-editing concepts and its participation in the evaluation of the Palo Alto Research Company's WikiDashboard.[10][11] [12] Commentary[edit] Wikipedia Review is not a conspiracy, a team-building exercise, a role-playing game, or an experiment in collusion. It is not meant as a resource or training ground for those who would instill fear and misery in others. It does not exist to corrupt, but to expose corruption; it does not exist to tear down institutions, but to expose the ways in which institutions are torn down; it does not exist to hate, but is meant to expose hate in others. To expose these things is not evil. It is not a monolithic entity, nor the sum of its parts. Like-mindedness does not imply singularity of purpose; respect for the rights of one group does not imply disrespect for the rights of another. It is not intended to be predictable, consistent, or dull. Imagine a world in which human beings are not user accounts, are not programmable, and are not mere words on a display screen. That's what we're doing... —?Statement made when the site was out of service in 2008, Wikipedia Review[13] Seth Finkelstein wrote in The Guardian that Wikipedia Review has provided a focal point for investigation into Wikipedia-related matters such as the "Essjay controversy".[14][15] Cade Metz, writing for The Register, credited Wikipedia Review with the discovery of a private mailing list that led to the resignation of a Wikipedia administrator; he also wrote that a Wikipedia proposal called "BADSITES" intended to ban the mention of Wikipedia Review and similar sites on Wikipedia.[16][17] The Independent noted that "allegations against certain administrators came to a head on a site called Wikipedia Review, where people debate the administrators' actions."[18] The Irish technology website Silicon Republic suggested visiting Wikipedia Review in order to "follow disputes, discussions, editors and general bureaucracy on Wikipedia".[19] Philip Coppens used posts made on Wikipedia Review to help construct a report, published in Nexus Magazine, on WikiScanner and allegations that intelligence agencies had been using Wikipedia to spread disinformation.[20] Content and structure[edit] Wikipedia Review's publicly accessible forums are broken up into four general topic areas: Forum information; Wikimedia-oriented discussion, which contains subforums focusing on editors, the Wikipedia bureaucracy, meta discussion, articles and general Wikimedia-focused topics not fitting elsewhere; Media forums containing a news feed and discussion about news and blogs featuring Wikipedia/Wikimedia; and Off topic, non-Wikimedia related discussion.[21] References[edit] ^ "Wikipediareview.com Site Info".
