WikiReader - Wikipedia WikiReader From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For the project to print books of Wikipedia articles, see Wikipedia:Books. WikiReader WikiReader displaying its virtual keyboard Manufacturer Openmoko Type Reader Operating system None (Embedded device) Forth interpreter is included CPU Epson S1C33 E07 microcontroller Storage MicroSD card Display Monochrome touchscreen Input Touch interface Power Two AAA batteries Dimensions 100 x 100 x 20 mm (3.9 x 3.9 x 0.8 inches) Mass 120 grams (4.2 oz) Website github.com/wikireader/wikireader WikiReader was a project to deliver an offline, text-only version of Wikipedia on a mobile device.[1] The project was sponsored by Openmoko and made by Pandigital, and its source code has been released.[2] The project debuted an offline portable reader for Wikipedia in October 2009.[1] Updates in multiple languages were available online[3][dead link] [4] and a twice-yearly offline update service delivered via Micro SD card was also available at a cost of $29 per year. Wikireader versions of the English Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote and Project Gutenberg can be installed together on a user-supplied 16 GB Micro SDHC Memory Card. Unlike Wikipedia itself, the device features parental controls.[5] The device can also run programs written in Forth; a simple calculator program is included.[6] In late 2014, the WikiReader website and project itself were shut down and abandoned for unknown reasons. Existing WikiReaders no longer receive updates to their database. Devices and homegrown updates are only available from the secondary markets.

The device therefore does not store or display any Wikipedia images.[12] Tables: The WikiReader does not display article text which appears inside a table on the Wikipedia Website (see Wikipedia:Tables). HTML "special characters": Certain Wikipedia article text encoded using HTML special characters is stripped from the WikiReader's output. Mathematical formulas: Original versions of the WikiReader do not display Wikipedia article information encoded as a formula using LaTeX (see Math markup). This has been addressed with an optional firmware update, which is pre-loaded on newer WikiReaders. Treatment of missing information: The WikiReader does not provide any indication of gaps where information has been deleted from a Wikipedia article. Images, tables, mathematical formulas and other information that was not encoded strictly as plain text in the original Wikipedia article is silently deleted from the WikiReader's output. Search: The WikiReader's search capabilities are basic. There is no full text search capability. Only the titles of Wikipedia articles can be searched. The WikiReader does support incremental search of article titles, beginning with the first characters of each title. Search terms must be spelled correctly. Wildcard searching is not supported.
