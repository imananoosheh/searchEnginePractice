1Lib1Ref - Wikipedia 1Lib1Ref From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Campaign for library engagement with Wikipedia The correct title of this article is #1Lib1Ref. The omission of the # is due to technical restrictions. #1Lib1Ref An Israeli librarian using Wikipedia (publicity photo for the project) Status Active Frequency Annual Location(s) Online Inaugurated 15 January 2016 (2016-01-15) – 23 January 2016 (2016-01-23) Next event 15 May 2020 (2020-05-15) – 5 June 2020 (2020-06-05) Organized by Wikipedia:GLAM Website 1lib1ref.org A Be like Bill meme relating to the campaign #1Lib1Ref is a Wikipedia campaign inviting every librarian on Earth to participate in the online encyclopedia project, specifically improving articles by adding citations. The first #1Lib1Ref campaign coincided with the 15th anniversary of the founding of Wikipedia in January 2016.[1][2][3] Based on the premise of One Librarian, One Reference, organizers estimated that if each librarian on the planet spent 15 minutes adding a citation, the combined effort would eliminate English Wikipedia's backlog of 350,000 [citation needed] notices.[4] The inaugural, weeklong event ran from 15–23 January 2016, and employed the hashtag #1lib1ref on various social media platforms.[5] Contents 1 Results of the first campaign 2 Recurring event 3 References 4 External links Results of the first campaign[edit] The inaugural campaign ended with 1,232 revisions on 879 pages, by 327 users in 9 languages, using the hashtag #1lib1ref in the edit summary; these numbers likely underestimate the overall impact, since many participants were observed omitting the hashtag from edit summaries. On Twitter the #1lib1ref hashtag was used in over 1,100 posts by over 630 users. [6] Recurring event[edit] The campaign has been revived as an annual celebration of Wikipedia's birthday,[7] expanding into a three-week event in subsequent years.[8] The 1Lib1Ref campaign is part of the Wikimedia Foundation's GLAM outreach strategy to involve librarians in the improvement of Wikipedia.[9] References[edit] ^ Rust, Amanda (14 January 2016).
