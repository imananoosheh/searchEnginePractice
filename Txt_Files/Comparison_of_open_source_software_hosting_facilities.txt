Comparison of source-code-hosting facilities - Wikipedia Comparison of source-code-hosting facilities From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Comparison of open source software hosting facilities) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikimedia list article See also: Collaborative development environment and comparison of version-control software A source-code repository is a file archive and web hosting facility for source code of software, documentation, web pages, and other works, accessible either publicly or privately. They are often used by open-source software projects and other multi-developer projects to maintain revision and version history, or version control. Many repositories provide a bug tracking system, and offer release management, mailing lists, and wiki-based project documentation. Software authors generally retain their copyright when software is posted to a code hosting facilities.
