List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes - Wikipedia List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikimedia list article For the original 1978–80 television series and Galactica 1980, see List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes. Battlestar Galactica is an American military science fiction television series, and part of the Battlestar Galactica franchise. The show was developed by Ronald D. Moore as a re-imagining of the 1978 Battlestar Galactica television series created by Glen A. Larson. The series first aired as a three-hour miniseries (comprising four broadcast hours) in December 2003 on the Sci-Fi Channel. The television series debuted in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on October 18, 2004, and premiered in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on January 14, 2005. The story arc of Battlestar Galactica is set in a distant star system, where a civilization of humans live on a series of planets known as the Twelve Colonies. In the past, the Colonies had been at war with a cybernetic race of their own creation, known as the Cylons. With the self-serving and venal help of a human named Gaius Baltar, the Cylons, some now in human form, launch a sudden sneak attack on the Colonies, laying waste to the planets and devastating their populations. Out of a population numbering in the billions, only approximately 50,000 humans survive, most of whom were aboard civilian spaceships that avoided destruction. Of all the Colonial Fleet, the eponymous Battlestar Galactica appears to be the only military capital ship that survived the attack. Under the leadership of Colonial Fleet officer Commander William "Bill" Adama and President Laura Roslin, the Galactica and its crew take up the task of leading the small fugitive fleet of survivors into space in search of a fabled refuge known as Earth.

It was split into three separate episodes on iTunes, Amazon Unbox, and other online providers, and the "third part", "Daybreak, Part 3" gives a survivor count of 39,406, which is relevant to the beginning of the episode at which The Colony has just been ordered to stand down. Later in the episode, when the fleet is orbiting the new Earth, Admiral Adama gives the last survivor count of the Colonials, putting the count at approximately "38,000." Thereafter the population assimilates with/into the society of the native Earth humans, and 150,000 years later, the population of the descendants of the Colonials is 6,760,000,000. ^ "Battlestar Galactica (mini-series)".
