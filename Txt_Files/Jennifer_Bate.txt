In 1986, she gave the first British performance of his Livre du Saint-Sacrement at Westminster Cathedral and later made the world premiere recording of the work under the personal supervision of the composer,[4] winning the Grand Prix du Disque.[3] She recorded the works at the Eglise de la Sainte-Trinite in Paris, and at the Beauvais Cathedral.[4] He also endorsed her earlier recordings of all of his other organ works. Bate owned scores which contain many personal markings and references made by him.[2][5] Bate had a broad repertoire spanning several centuries.[4] She recorded the complete organ works of César Franck and the complete organ music of Felix Mendelssohn, about which a reviewer wrote of the "easy fluency of her technique" and "her highly articulate and intelligent interpretations".[4] She recorded much English organ music, from John Stanley to Samuel Wesley, and the complete organ works by Peter Dickinson, whose Organ Concerto she premiered and first recorded.[4] She appeared at The Proms four times between 1974 and 2008.[3][6] Bate was briefly married (as his second wife) to Sir George Thalben-Ball.[4] She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol in 2007.[2] She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.[7] She became an officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and a chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur in 2012.[3] Bate died of cancer on 25 March 2020.[3][4] References[edit] ^ May, Philippa (23 April 2019).
