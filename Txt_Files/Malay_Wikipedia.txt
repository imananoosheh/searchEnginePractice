Screenshot Wikipedia Bahasa Melayu Type of site Online encyclopedia Available in Malay Headquarters Miami, Florida Owner Wikimedia Foundation URL ms.wikipedia.org Commercial No Registration Optional Launched October 26, 2002 Malay Wikipedia (Malay: Wikipedia Bahasa Melayu, Jawi alphabet: ????????? ???? ?????, abbreviation: mswiki) is the Malay edition of Wikipedia. This edition was started on 26 October 2002 and has about 323,162 articles as of January 2019 and is the 29th largest Wikipedia. The system was activated by Wikipedia administrator Brion Vibber.[1][2] Despite the similarities between Malay and Indonesian, the Malay Wikipedia and Indonesian Wikipedia were started separately by two different user groups. The Indonesian Wikipedia was started about six months after the Malay Wikipedia was. As of 2009, the Indonesian Wikipedia had three times the number of active editors and articles the Malay Wikipedia had. In 2009 Andrew Lih wrote "Because these groups are drawn on national boundaries, merging is not likely to happen soon."[3] Starting 27 July 2016, file upload at the Malay Wikipedia (along with Czech, Spanish, Basque, Gujarati, Portuguese, Simple English and Swedish Wikipedia)[a] is no longer facilitated and instead redirected to Wikimedia Commons due to copyright infringement issues. However, file upload at the English, Indonesian and other languaged Wikipedia remains operable. Since 2016, Malay Wikipedia has had a dearth of administrators.[citation needed] Contents 1 Milestones 2 Topics 3 Gallery 4 References 5 Notes 6 Footnotes 7 External links Milestones[edit] 200,000 - March 21, 2013 - Belforte Monferrato 190,000 - February 25, 2013 - Galeri Petronas 178,000 - February 6, 2013 - Doubravice (Daerah ?eské Bud?jovice) 125,000 - November 15, 2011 - Morbecque 120,000 - June 9, 2011 - La Biolle 115,000 - March 22, 2011 - Raj British 110,000 - February 23, 2011 - Oëlleville 105,000 - February 2, 2011 - Bassy 100,000 - January 9, 2011 - Pressigny-les-Pins Topics[edit] In 2019 the Malay Wikipedia had 91,000 unique categories; 68.65% of them do not have appropriate page in the category namespace.
