She continued at Imperial, completing her Doctor of Philosophy degree in physics in 2016,[5][15] where her thesis on nanometrology in organic semiconductors was supervised by Ji-Seon Kim.[5] Research and career[edit] Wade's research interests are in materials science, chiral materials and circular polarisation.[8] As of 2020[update], Wade is a postdoctoral research associate in plastic electronics in the solid-state physics group at Imperial College London, focusing on developing and characterising light-emitting polymer thin films[16][17] working with Alasdair Campbell and Matt Fuchter.[9] Her research has been published in scientific journals such as the Journal of Physical Chemistry C,[18] the Journal of the American Chemical Society,[19] the Journal of Materials Chemistry,[20][21] ACS Nano,[22] Advanced Functional Materials,[23] The Journal of Chemical Physics,[24] Advanced Electronic Materials,[25] ChemComm[26] and Energy & Environmental Science.[27] She has co-authored research papers with James Durrant,[21][27][26][24] Henning Sirringhaus,[19] Jenny Nelson,[22] Donal Bradley,[20][25] and Ji-Seon Kim.[18] As of August 2019[update], according to Web of Science, she is the first author of four papers and a middle author on another 14. Her research (first author) has been cited 25 times, and her middle author papers have been cited 420 times. Her h-index is 8, and her m-quotient is 1.1.[28] Public engagement and outreach[edit] Wade has contributed to public engagement to increase gender equality in Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. She represented the UK on the United States Department of State funded International Visitor Leadership Program Hidden No More,[29] and served on the WISE Campaign Young Women's Board and Women's Engineering Society (WES) Council, working with teachers across the country through the Stimulating Physics Network (including keynote talks at education fairs and teacher conferences). Wade has been critical of expensive campaigns to encourage girls into science where there is an implication that only a small minority would be interested, or that girls can study the "chemical composition of lipsticks and nail varnish".[3][30] She estimates that £5m or £6m is spent in the UK to promote a scientific career for women but with little measurement of the results.[3] Wade has made a large contribution to a Wikipedia campaign that encourages the creation of Wikipedia articles about notable female academics, in order to promote female role models in STEM.[31][32][33] Wade has created new Wikipedia biographical articles to raise the profile of minorities in STEM.[34][11][12][35] She told Chemistry World in mid-2019 that of the 600 articles about female scientists she has written, 6 have been deleted because of the notability issue. Yet, Wade said, the site has articles about the most obscure sports players and forgotten pop songs.[36] As of February 2020, she had written over 900 biographies on Wikipedia.[37] Wade coordinated a team for the 6th International Women in Physics Conference, resulting in an invitation to discuss the Institute of Physics (IOP) gender balance work in Germany.[38] She also supports the engagement of school students through school activities and festivals, and the organisation of a series of events for girls at Imperial College London, which she has funded with grants from the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng), the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and the Biochemical Society.[39] In 2015 Wade won the science engagement activity I'm a Scientist, Get me out of here![40] and received £500, which she used to run a greenlight4girls day in the department of physics at Imperial College London.[41] Wade serves on the IOP London and South East Committee,[42] the IOP Women in Physics Committee[43] and the Juno transparency and opportunity committee at Imperial.[44] She cites her influences as Sharmadean Reid, Lesley Cohen, Jenny Nelson[4] and Angela Saini, particularly her book Inferior.[3] Her outreach work has been covered by the BBC,[1][45] Sky News,[46] HuffPost,[30] ABC News,[47] Physics World,[10] El País,[32] CNN,[33] Nature,[7][48] and The Guardian.[3][49][50] Wade was interviewed as part of TEDx London Women, held on 1 December 2018.[51][52] With Ben Britton and Christopher Jackson, she co-authored The reward and risk of social media for academics in the journal Nature Reviews Chemistry.[53] Female scientists on Wikipedia[edit] A controversy regarding allegations that insufficient coverage within the English-language Wikipedia is being given to women making contributions to science became widely noted when the 12 April 2019 Washington Post published an op-ed entitled "The Black Hole Photo Is Just One Example of Championing Women in Science",[54] co-authored by Maryam Zaringhalam and Wade. In part, the article decried that previous discussions among Wikipedia's volunteer editors resulted in the biographical entries originally created by Wade for some female scientists non-inclusion on the website,[55][56] one from among hundreds of articles on women scientists that Wade had contributed to that time, with perhaps approximately one percent of these submissions declined.[57] With regard to one such article, Wade had heard about nuclear chemist Clarice Phelps from Kit Chapman, who had been conducting research for his book Superheavy: Making and Breaking the Periodic Table (2019) with intention "to make science more accessible. I hope that looking back and seeing this cast and some of the diversity that’s reflected in the past, we can get more diversity in the future."[58] Wade created a short Wikipedia biography of Phelps in September 2018[59] which was deleted February, 11 2019,[55] the catalyst of a prolonged editorial discussion and, approaching a type of dispute discouraged among the website's volunteer administrators,[60][61][62] its multiple restorations and re-deletions.[63][64] Chemistry World said:[64] In Phelps’ case, her name didn’t appear in the articles announcing tennessine’s discovery. She wasn’t profiled by mainstream media. Most mentions of her work are on her employer’s website – a source that’s not classed as independent by Wikipedia standards and therefore not admissible when it comes to establishing notability. The [Wikipedia] community consensus was that her biography had to go. Wade said to Chemistry World she believes such omissions of scientific researchers from coverage in Wikipedia are regrettable, noting how it's her impression it accepts entries for even the most-obscure popular-media figures.[64] By January 2020, there was a consensus to restore the article, as by then new sources had become available.[65] Awards and honours[edit] Wade has received several awards for contributions to science, science communication, diversity, and inclusion. In 2015, Wade was awarded the Institute of Physics Early Career Physics Communicator Prize[66] and the Imperial College Union award for contribution to college life,[67] and was the winner of the Colour Zone in I'm a Scientist, Get Me Out of Here, an online science engagement project run by Mangorolla CIC.[68] The next year, Wade received the Institute of Physics's Jocelyn Bell Burnell Medal and Prize for Women in Physics 2016.[15] In 2017, Wade won the Robert Perrin Award for Materials Science[69][70] from the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining, and Imperial College's Julia Higgins Medal in recognition of her work to support gender equality.[71][72] She was invited to the interdisciplinary science conference Science Foo Camp at the Googleplex in California.[73] During 2018, Wade won the Daphne Jackson Medal and Prize for "acting as an internationally-recognised ambassador for STEM".[74] In December she was named as one of Nature's 10 people who mattered in science that year.[7] She received an honourable mention in the Wikimedian of the Year award by Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, for her "year long effort to write about underrepresented scientists and engineers on Wikipedia",[75] and the following year was chosen as Wikimedian of the Year by her national chapter, Wikimedia UK.[76] Wade was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to gender diversity in science.[6][77] Her employer honoured her that year with its Leadership Award for Societal Engagement.[78] Also in 2019, Wade was named as the 44th 'Most Influential Woman in UK Tech' by Computer Weekly.[79] Gallery of external features[edit] References[edit] Scholia has an author profile for Jess Wade. ^ a b Jackson, Marie; Scott, Jennifer (2018).
