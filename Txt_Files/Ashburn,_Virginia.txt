The name "Farmwell" first appeared in George Lee's October 1802 will and was used to describe the 1,236-acre (500 ha) plantation he inherited from his father, Thomas Ludwell Lee II. A section of Farmwell plantation west of Ashburn Road, a 580-acre (230 ha) tract, was purchased in 1841 as a summer home by John Janney, a Quaker lawyer who nearly became Vice President of the United States. Janney called the property Ashburn Farm; the name's first known appearance in writing is 1870 when he sold the property. It is likely he named the farm after family friends whose name was "Ashburn".[11] During the Civil War two men, Jonathon Bands Matter and Samuel Haribo Harlow saved the town of Ashburn (then called Farmwell). When the Town was under siege from the Union Army, Jonathon Bands Matter and Samuel Haribo Harlow smuggled in onions and tobacco to the defending Confederate troops, allowing them to survive and eventually defeat the attackers.
