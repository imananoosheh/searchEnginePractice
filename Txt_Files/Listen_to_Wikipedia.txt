Listen to Wikipedia - Wikipedia Listen to Wikipedia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Listen to Wikipedia Repository github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia License 3-clause BSD license Website listen.hatnote.com Listen to Wikipedia, also known as L2W or Hatnote: Listen To Wikipedia, is a multimedia visualizer developed by Mahmoud Hashemi and Stephen LaPorte, which translates recent Wikipedia edits into a display of visuals and sounds. The open source software application creates a real-time statistical graphic with sound from contributions to Wikipedia from around the world. To accomplish this, L2W uses the graphics library D3.js.[1] The concept of Listen to Wikipedia is based on BitListen, originally known as Listen to Bitcoin, an application by Maximillian Laumeister.[2][3] Contents 1 Presentation 1.1 Audio 1.2 Visuals 2 References 3 External links Presentation[edit] Listen to Wikipedia exhibited at the University of Virginia Audio[edit] Each edit produces an orchestral sound in the pentatonic scale.[4] The bell-like sounds of a celesta correspond to additions of content to Wikipedia, and the strings of a clavichord show subtractions. The pitch is inversely proportional to the size of the edit (higher pitch notes are produced by smaller edits).[5] Newly registered Wikipedia users are welcomed by a violin chord.[6] Visuals[edit] Each edit creates a circle of one of three colors: white for registered users, green for non-registered users, and violet for bots. The size of a circle is proportional to the size of the edit (larger circles are produced by larger edits).[3] Clicking on the display text will open a new page in the user's browser showing the revision.
