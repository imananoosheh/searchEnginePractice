Open collaboration - Wikipedia Open collaboration From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Coordinated participants who interact to create a product or service Open collaboration is "any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value, which they make available to contributors and noncontributors alike."[1] It is prominently observed in open source software, but can also be found in many other instances, such as in Internet forums,[2] mailing lists[3] and online communities.[4] Open collaboration is also thought to be the operating principle underlining a gamut of diverse ventures, including bitcoin, TEDx, and Wikipedia.[5] Open collaboration is the principle underlying peer production, mass collaboration, and wikinomics.[citation needed] It was observed initially in open source software, but can also be found in many other instances, such as in Internet forums,[2] mailing lists,[citation needed] Internet communities,[4] and many instances of open content, such as creative commons. It also explains some instances of crowdsourcing, collaborative consumption, and open innovation.[6] Riehle et al. define open collaboration as collaboration based on three principles of egalitarianism, meritocracy, and self-organization.[7] White and White define open collaboration as "any system of innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who interact to create a product (or service) of economic value, which they make available to contributors and noncontributors alike."[citation needed] This definition captures multiple instances, all joined by similar principles. For example, all of the elements — goods of economic value, open access to contribute and consume, interaction and exchange, purposeful yet loosely coordinated work — are present in an open source software project, in Wikipedia, or in a user forum or community. They can also be present in a commercial website that is based on user-generated content. In all of these instances of open collaboration, anyone can contribute and anyone can freely partake in the fruits of sharing, which are produced by interacting participants who are loosely coordinated. An annual conference dedicated to the research and practice of open collaboration is the International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym, formerly WikiSym).[8] As per its website, the group defines open collaboration as "collaboration that is egalitarian (everyone can join, no principled or artificial barriers to participation exist), meritocratic (decisions and status are merit-based rather than imposed) and self-organizing (processes adapt to people rather than people adapt to pre-defined processes)."[9] See also[edit] Commons-based peer production Money-free market Open-source model Resource-based economy References[edit] ^ Levine, Sheen S., & Prietula, M.
