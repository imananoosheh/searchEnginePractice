Yiddish Wikipedia - Wikipedia Yiddish Wikipedia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with Hebrew Wikipedia. This article may be expanded with text translated from the corresponding article in Yiddish. (August 2011) Click [show] for important translation instructions. View a machine-translated version of the Yiddish article. Machine translation like DeepL or Google Translate is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia. Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality. If possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article. You must provide copyright attribution in the edit summary accompanying your translation by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation. A model attribution edit summary Content in this edit is translated from the existing Yiddish Wikipedia article at [[:yi:?????? ??????????]]; see its history for attribution. You should also add the template {{Translated|yi|?????? ??????????}} to the talk page. For more guidance, see Wikipedia:Translation.

There are 35,571 registered users (including bots); 41 are active, including 3 administrators. Like all Wikipedias it generates hits from Yiddish words typed in Google, with Wikipedia articles appearing at the top of the results for that word. In accordance with the norms for the Yiddish language, it is written almost exclusively in Hebrew script, and not in Latin script. Milestones[edit] The Yiddish Wikipedia reached 6,000 articles on March 8, 2009. The 6,000th article is ????? ????? ??????-??????, a rabbi. The 7,000th article is ????? ??? ??????, a page about the tanna Hanina Segan ha-Kohanim created on December 24, 2009. Point of view[edit] Combined, the different Hasidic groups form the largest Yiddish-speaking community in the world today. Many new articles are about Hasidic rabbis.[2] References[edit] ^ "Yiddish Wikipedia now active". wikipedia.international mailinglist. March 16, 2004.
