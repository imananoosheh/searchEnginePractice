Arabic Wikipedia - Wikipedia Arabic Wikipedia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Arabic Wikipedia Screenshot Type of site Internet encyclopedia project Available in Arabic Headquarters Miami, Florida Owner Wikimedia Foundation Created by Arab wiki community URL ar.wikipedia.org Commercial No Registration Optional Launched 9 July 2003; 16 years ago (2003-07-09)[1] The Arabic Wikipedia (Arabic: ????????? ????????) is the Arabic language version of Wikipedia. It started on 9 July 2003. As of March 2020, it has 1,034,943 articles, 1,756,053 registered users and 33,509 files and it is the 15th largest edition of Wikipedia by article count, and ranks 12th in terms of depth among Wikipedias that are above 50,000 articles. It was the first Semitic language to exceed 100,000 articles[2] on 25 May 2009, and also the first Semitic language to exceed 1 million articles on 17 November 2019.[3] The design of the Arabic Wikipedia differs somewhat from other Wikipedias. Most notably, since Arabic is written right-to-left, the location of links is a mirror image of those Wikipedias in languages written left-to-right. Prior to Wikipedia's update to MediaWiki 1.16, Arabic Wikipedia had a default page background of the site inspired by Arabic/Islamic tiling or ornament styles. Switching from MediaWiki's new default Vector layout to the original MonoBook layout may restore this page background.

Elizabeth Bauer, who used the user name Elian in the Arabic Wikipedia, approached many Arabic speakers who potentially might be interested in volunteering to spearhead the Arabic project. The only group who responded was the ArabEyes team who were involved in Arabizing the Open Source initiatives. Elian's request was conservatively received and the ArabEyes team was ready to participate but not take a leadership role[7] and then declined to participate on the second of February 2003. During this negotiation time, volunteer users from the German Wikipedia project continued to develop the technical infrastructure of the Arabic Wikipedia backbone.[8][9] In 2003 Rami Tarawneh (Arabic: ???? ??? ?????????), a Jordanian PhD student in Germany who originated from Zarqa, encountered the English Wikipedia and began to edit content. Contributors encouraged him to start an Arabic Wikipedia.[10] The Arabic Wikipedia opened in July 2003.[11] By that year a significant group of contributors included Tarawneh and four other Jordanians studying in Germany.[10] On 7 February 2004,[12] one member from the ArabEyes, Isam Bayazidi (Arabic: ???? ????????), volunteered with 4 other friends to be involved with the Arabic Wikipedia and assumed some leadership roles. In 2004, Bayazid was assigned the SysOp responsibilities and he, with another 5 volunteers, namely Ayman, Abo Suleiman, Mustapha Ahmad and Bassem Jarkas[13] are considered to be the first Arabs to lead the Wikipedia project and they are attributed for working on translating and enforcing the English policies to Arabic. The Arabic Wikipedia faced many challenges at its inception. In February 2004, it was considered to be the worst Wikipedia project among all other languages. However, in 2005, it showed phenomenal progress by which in December 2005, the total number of articles reached 8,285.[14] By that time, there were fewer than 20 contributors and the administrators and contributors made efforts to recruit new users.[10] In 2007 the secret police in an unspecified country detained Tarawneh and demanded that he reveal the IP address of a contributor. To protect the Wikipedian, the administrators forged a dispute that was the presumed reason for Tarawneh losing his administrator access, so the secret police was unable to obtain the IP. In response to the incident, the rules now state that no one user may have access to all information about the Wikipedia's users.[10] Second Conference of the Wikipedia Education Program in Cairo University, Egypt, 27 February 2013 In 2008 the Wikipedia had had fewer than 65,000 articles and was ranked No. 29 out of the Wikipedias, behind the Esperanto Wikipedia and the Slovenian Wikipedia. Noam Cohen of The New York Times reported that, to many of the attendees of the 2008 Wikimania conference in Alexandria, Egypt, the "woeful shape of the Arabic Wikipedia has been the cause of chagrin."[15] Cohen stated that out of Egyptians, fewer than 10% "are thought to have internet access" and of those with internet access many tend to be knowledgeable in English and have a preference of communicating in that language.[15] The Arabic Wikipedia had 118,870 articles as of 15 January 2010. As of July 2012 there are around 630 active Arabic Wikipedia editors around the world. Ikram Al-Yacoub of Al Arabiya says that this is "a relatively low figure."[16] At the time there were hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia articles on the Arabic Wikipedia.[10] The Wikimedia Foundation and the nonprofit group Taghreedat established the "Arabic Wikipedia Editors Program" intended to train users to edit the Arabic Wikipedia.[16] By the end of June 2014, the number of articles had reached 384,000[17] Iraqi volunteers have translated much of English Wikipedia into Arabic Wikipedia.[18] Blocking[edit] The Arabic Wikipedia has been blocked in Syria with no official reasons given by the Syrian government.[19] The block began on 30 April 2008 while all other language versions of Wikipedia remain unblocked and freely accessible. And it is still blocked in the country so far.[when?] Wikimedia.org[when?] continues to be blocked, which causes all images on Wikipedia (in all languages) to be unavailable.[citation needed] Tarawneh stated that wasta was used to unblock Wikipedia in Syria.[10] Evaluation and criticism[edit] Map showing which countries the page views for Arabic Wikipedia come from Page views to different Wikipedia language versions in Northern Africa and the Middle East, September 2009 to July 2010[20] In June 2016, Arabic Wikipedia scored 233 in terms of depth (a very rough indicator of the encyclopedia's quality). This is better than the German version (102), the French version (207) or the Japanese version (74), making it the fifth highest +100,000 articles Wikipedia in the terms of depth, after English Wikipedia (930), Serbo-Croatian Wikipedia (561), Thai Wikipedia (253) and Hebrew Wikipedia (251).[21] At Wikimania 2008, Jimmy Wales argued that high-profile arrests like those of Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer could be hampering the development of the Arabic Wikipedia by making editors afraid to contribute.[22] In 2010, Tarek Al Kaziri, from Radio Netherlands Worldwide, believed that the Arabic Wikipedia reflected the Arabic reality in general. Low participation lowers the probability that the articles are reviewed, developed and updated, and political polarisation of participants is likely to lead to biases in the articles.[23] According to Alexa Internet, on 26 November 2014, the Arabic Wikipedia is the 10th most visited language version of Wikipedia in terms of percentage of visitors on all of the Wikipedias over a month, with the "ar.wikipedia.org" subdomain attracting approximately 1.8% of the total visitors of the "wikipedia.org" website,[24] despite being ranked no. 22 in term of the article count. In terms of page views, it is ranked 12th with the same 10 Wikipedias above it plus the Polish and Dutch ones.[25] In 2019 the Arabic Wikipedia has 577 thousand unique categories and 1.1% of them do not have appropriate page in the category namespace. The average article in this language version has 30 categories, while number of unique categories per articles ratio is 0.806. The largest number of articles has Culture (21%) and People (11%) category. In Arabic Wikipedia articles related to Religion and Military has the highest average quality. Content about Religion is read more often and has the highest authors' interest on average.[26] Usage and page views by country[edit] Florence Devouard, the former president of the Wikimedia Foundation, stated in 2010 that the largest number of articles on the Arabic Wikipedia were written by Egyptians and that the Egyptians were more likely to participate in the Arabic Wikipedia compared to other groups.[27] June 2018[28][edit] Rank Country % of views 1 Saudi Arabia 22.3% 2 Egypt 12.9% 3 Morocco 10.4% 4 United States 7.1% 5 Algeria 7.0% 6 Iraq 5.3% 7 Jordan 3.7% 8 Kuwait 3.0% 9 United Arab Emirates 2.9% 10 Syria 2.2% As a percent of total Wikipedia views[edit] Rank Country % of views 1 June 2018 - 30 June 2018[29] 1 Algeria 42.5% 2 Bahrain 30.3% 3 Chad 21.7% 4 Egypt 60.5% 5 Iraq 67.9% 6 Israel 3.2% 7 Jordan 67.9% 8 Kuwait 48.2% 9 Lebanon 28.8% 10 Libya 74.3% 11 Mali 2.7% 12 Mauritania 50.9% 13 Morocco 45.3% 14 Niger 3.6% 15 Oman 43.9% 16 Palestine 73.7% 17 Qatar 20.5% 18 Saudi Arabia 68.6% 19 Senegal 1.8% 20 Somalia 11.1% 21 South Sudan 12.5% 22 Sudan 73.8% 23 Syria 77.2% 24 Tunisia 26.8% 25 Turkey 3.6% 26 United Arab Emirates 12.2% 27 Yemen 85.5% Milestones[edit] Arabic Wikipedia was launched in September 2001, yet due to MediaWiki software migration, the oldest surviving edit dates back to 9 July 2003.
