While his mother is not Jewish, he lost family members on his father's side in the Holocaust.[2][3] After Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys, he studied PPE at New College, Oxford[4] and Birkbeck College, University of London.[citation needed] He began his career at the Bank of England and worked in the securities industry and investment banking.[5] Career[edit] Kamm joined the Times staff in 2008.[6] He has also contributed to The Jewish Chronicle, for which he writes regularly,[7] Prospect magazine,[8] and The Guardian.[9] Views[edit] Kamm has been a consistent supporter of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the foreign policies of his government.[10] According to John Lloyd in 2005, Kamm views Blair's policies "as the expression of true social-democratic values".[10] At its launch in 2005, Kamm subscribed to the founding principles of the Henry Jackson Society[11] and was an initial signatory, but now has no connection with it. He states that he is a friend and admirer of Israel.[12] Kamm has been an opponent of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He told Liam Hoare writing for The Forward magazine in September 2015, that "the left has incorporated the attitudes of the nativist far-right. Corbyn's alliances with reactionary, misogynistic, theocratic, and anti-Semitic movements bear out what we’ve said".[13] Commentator Peter Wilby asserted that, while Kamm and Stephen Pollard of the Jewish Chronicle claim "to be left-wing", they hold "no discernible left-wing views".[14] When interviewed by politics academic Norman Geras in 2003, Kamm said that he wrote to "express a militant liberalism that I feel ought to be part of public debate but which isn't often articulated, or at least not where I can find it, in the communications media that I read or listen to" and that he felt that "the crucial distinction in politics is not between Left and Right, as I had once tribally thought, but between the defenders and the enemies of an open society."[5] Kamm supports the return of the Elgin Marbles.[15][16] Kamm has been criticised for anti-Catholicism following his comments towards the Catholic Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey.[17] Kamm has described himself as an 'Islamophobe' [18] Kamm opposed the prosecution of far-right politician Geert Wilders.[19] Books[edit] Kamm has written two books. In Anti-Totalitarianism, he argues that military intervention against totalitarian regimes to support democratic values in other countries, can be expression of left wing values; he supports the 2003 invasion of Iraq under this rubric and seemed to be focusing his argument against foreign policies stances based narrowly on the national interest that are typical of the traditional right.[20] On his book on usage, Accidence Will Happen, he argues against linguistic prescription and in favour of linguistic description.[21] In August 2018, The Bookseller reported that Weidenfeld & Nicolson will in January 2020 publish Kamm's book In Mending the Mind: The Art and Science of Treating Clinical Depression, in which he "draws on his own experience of the illness as a jumping off point to investigate depression" and "makes a case for embracing both art and science to better understand and treat the condition."[22] Bibliography[edit] Kamm, Oliver (2005).
