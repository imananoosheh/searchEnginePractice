Geographical name changes in Turkey - Wikipedia Geographical name changes in Turkey From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Geographical name changes in Turkey have been undertaken, periodically, in bulk from 1913 to the present by successive Turkish governments. Thousands of names within the Turkish Republic or the Ottoman Empire have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably Turkish names, as part of the Turkification policy. The governments have argued that such names are foreign or divisive. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Zazaki, Syriac, Yazidi[1] or Arabic origin. Turkey's efforts to join the European Union in the early 21st century have led to a decrease in the incidence of such changes from local, and particularly the central government. In some cases legislation has restored the names of certain villages (primarily those housing Kurdish and Zaza minorities).[citation needed] Place names that have formally changed frequently persist in local dialects and languages throughout the ethnically diverse country. The policy commenced during the final years of the Ottoman Empire and continued into the Turkish Republic. Under the Kemalist oriented government, specialized governmental commissions were created for the purpose of changing names. Approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, which included 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. Most name changes occurred in the eastern regions of the country where minority ethnicities form a large part or a majority of the population. Policies at times included banning the use of foreign names that were considered divisive and inappropriate. Enver Pasha issued an edict in 1916 that all place names originating from non-Muslim peoples would be changed Contents 1 History 1.1 Ottoman Empire 1.2 Republic of Turkey 1.3 Current status 2 Comparative analysis 3 Notable geographical name changes 3.1 Armenian 3.2 Assyrian 3.3 Greek 3.4 Kurdish and Zazaki 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] For changes throughout Turkey's recorded history before 1913 see individual geographical articles such as Istanbul. Ottoman Empire[edit] The Committee of Union and Progress took the reins of the Ottoman government through a coup d'état in 1913.[2] At the height of World War I and during the final years of the Ottoman Empire, when the ethnic cleansing policies of non-Muslim Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian minorities were underway, Minister of War Enver Pasha issued an edict (ferman) on October 6, 1916, declaring:[3][4][5][6][7] It has been decided that provinces, districts, towns, villages, mountains, and rivers, which are named in languages belonging to non-Muslim nations such as Armenian, Greek or Bulgarian, will be renamed into Turkish. In order to benefit from this suitable moment, this aim should be achieved in due course. General Directorate of State Archives of the Republic of Turkey, ?stanbul Vilayet Mektupçulu?u, no. 000955, 23 Kânunuevvel 1331 (October 6, 1916) Ordinance of Enver Pa?a Enver Pasha did not change the geographical names belonging to Muslim minorities (i.e. Arabs and Kurds) due to the Ottoman government's role as a Caliphate.[8] His decree inspired many Turkish intellectuals to write in support of such measures. One such intellectual, Hüseyin Avni Alparslan (1877–1921), a Turkish soldier and author of books about Turkish language and culture, was inspired by the efforts of Enver Pasha, writing in his book Trabzon ?li Lâz m?? Türk mü? (Is the Trabzon province Laz or Turkish?) that:[9] If we want to be the owner of our country, then we should turn even the name of the smallest village into Turkish and not leave its Armenian, Greek or Arabic variants. Only in this way can we paint our country with its colors. It is not known how many geographical names were changed under the ordinance. The ultimate overarching objective behind it failed due to the collapse of the Ottoman government and trials of its leaders before Ottoman and European courts for massacres against ethnic minorities committed in 1915.[6][10] A decreased level of cultural repression has taken place in the Turkish Republic; however, non-mainstream Turkic origin place names have invariably been officially renamed over the course of time.[5][8] Republic of Turkey[edit] Turkish nationalism and secularism were two of the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic.[11] Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the leader of the early decades of the Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify[12][8][6] geographical names were a recurring theme.[13][14][15][16] Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).[17] By 1927, all street and square names in Istanbul which were not of Turkish origin were changed.[18][19] In 1940 the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA) issued a circular which called for original or foreign language place names to be substituted with Turkish place names.[20] Journalist and writer Ay?e Hür has noted that after the death of Atatürk and during the Democratic period of the Turkish Republic in the late 1940s and 50s, "ugly, humiliating, insulting or derisive names, even if they were Turkish, were subjected to changes. Village names with lexical components meaning red (kizil), bell (çan), church (kilise, e.g. Kirk Kilise) were changed. To do away with "separatist notions", the Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Kurdish, Georgian, Tatar, Circassian, and Laz village names were also changed."[21] The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad De?i?tirme ?htisas Kurulu) was created in 1952 under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior.[20] It was invested with the power to change all names that were not within the jurisdiction of the municipalities like streets, parks or places. In the commission were representatives from the Turkish Language Society (Türk Dil Kurumu), from the faculties geography, language and history from the Ankara University, the Military General Staff and the ministries of Defense, Internal Affair and education. The committee was working until 1978 and 35% of the villages in Turkey got their names changed.[20] The initiative proved successful, as approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, including 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names.[22][23][24][25][26] This figure also included names of streets, monuments, quarters, neighborhoods, and other components that make up certain municipalities.[13][22][18] The committee was reinstated after the military coup of 1980 in 1983 and it changed the names of 280 villages. It was closed again in 1985 due to inefficiency.[20] During the heightened tension between Kurdish rebels and the Turkish government, the focus of geographical name changing in the 1980s was on Kurdish villages, towns, rivers.etc.[12][27] In 1981, the Turkish government stated in the preface of Köylerimiz, a publication dedicated to names of Turkish villages, that: Approximately 12,000 village names that are non-Turkish, understood to originate from non-Turkish roots, and identified as causing confusion have been examined and replaced with Turkish names, and put into effect by the Substitution Committee for Foreign Names functioning at the Directorate General for Provincial Governments in our Ministry.[28] At the culmination of the policy, no geographical or topographical names of non-Turkish origin remained.[15] Some of the newer names resembled their native names, but with revised Turkish connotations (i.e. Aghtamar was changed to Akdamar). Current status[edit] Although geographical names have been formally changed in Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country.[29] At times, Turkish politicians have also used the native names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when addressing a crowd in the town of Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used the native name Nor?in.[30] Also that year, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo?an used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.[30] Efforts at restoring the former names of geographical terms have been recently introduced in Turkey.[31] In September 2012, legislation was introduced to restore the names of (primarily Kurdish) villages to their former native names.[32] According to the bill, the province of Tunceli would be named Dersim, Güroymak would be named Nor?in, and Ayd?nlar would be named Tilo.[32] But the Turkish Government authority was opposed to the name Dersim as the local municipality wanted to introduce the name Dersim for Tunceli.[33] Comparative analysis[edit] Most of the geographical name changes occurred in the eastern provinces of the country and on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where minority populations tend to live. Through independent study, etymologist Sevan Ni?anyan estimates that, of the geographical location name changes, 4,200 were Greek, 4,000 Kurdish, 3,600 Armenian, 750 Arabic, 400 Assyrian, 300 Georgian, 200 Laz, and 50 others.[5][13][14][15][16] The official statistics of The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Degistirme Ihtisas Komisyonu) claim that the total number of villages, towns, cities, and settlements renamed is 12,211.[22][24] The chart below lists the provinces and the number of villages or towns renamed.[34][27] Percentage of geographical name changes in Turkey from 1916 onwards Province Number Province Number Province Number Province Number Province Number Erzurum 653 Kastamonu 295 Giresun 167 Amasya 99 Denizli 53 Mardin 647 Gaziantep 279 Zonguldak 156 Kütahya 93 Burdur 49 Diyarbak?r 555 Tunceli 273 Bursa 136 Yozgat 90 Ni?de 48 Van 415 Bingöl 247 Ordu 134 Afyon 88 U?ak 47 Sivas 406 Tokat 245 Hakkari 128 Kayseri 86 Isparta 46 Kars 398 Bitlis 236 Hatay 117 Manisa 83 K?r?ehir 39 Siirt 392 Konya 236 Sakarya 117 Çank?r? 76 K?rklareli 35 Trabzon 390 Ad?yaman 224 Mersin 112 Eski?ehir 70 Bilecik 32 ?anl?urfa 389 Malatya 217 Bal?kesir 110 Mu?la 70 Kocaeli 26 Elaz?? 383 Ankara 193 Kahramanmara? 105 Ayd?n 69 Nev?ehir 24 A?r? 374 Samsun 185 Rize 105 ?zmir 68 Istanbul 21 Erzincan 366 Bolu 182 Çorum 103 Sinop 59 Edirne 20 Gümü?hane 343 Adana 169 Artvin 101 Çanakkale 53 Tekirda? 19 Mu? 297 Antalya 168 Notable geographical name changes[edit] Armenian[edit] Main article: Armenian cultural heritage in Turkey Armenian geographic names were first changed under the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In 1880, the word Armenia was banned from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments, to be replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan.[35][36][37][38][39] Armenian name changing continued under the early Republican era up until the 21st century. It included the Turkification of last names, change of animal names,[40] change of the names of Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family was concealed under the identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani),[41][42] and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.[43] Most Armenian geographical names were in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, Nakhichevan, Tatvan), signify an Armenian name.[8] Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Nor?in). This was especially true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.[8] Sevan Ni?anyan estimates that 3,600 Armenian geographical locations have been changed.[5] Armenian geographical names renamed in Turkey Notable name changes of Armenian geographical locations:[44][45] Armenian name Named changed to: Notes Govdun Goydun Armenian: "House of cows" Aghtamar Akdamar Of unknown meaning[46] Turkish: White vein Akn E?in, later Kemaliye Armenian: "Fountain"[47] Manavazkert Malazgirt Armenian: "City of Menua" (named after Urartian king Menua) Vostan Geva? Armenian: "Belongs to King" Kayl Ket Kelkit River Armenian: "Wolf River".[48] The village of Kelkit in the Gümü?hane Province also gets its name from the Kelkit River. Norashen Güroymak Armenian: "New city". A proposal has been introduced to restore its former name. The Kurdish community of Güroymak claim it is a Kurdish native name called "Nor?in".[32] Zeytun Süleymanl? Armenian: "Olive". Turkish: named after Turkish general Suleyman who captured the village in 1915.[49] Çermuk Çermik Armenian: "Hot springs" Khachkar Kaçkar Armenian: Khachkar or cross-stone.[50][51] Everek Develi Derives from the Armenian word Averag meaning ruins. Karpert Harput, later Elâz?? Armenian: "Rock fortress" Ani An?[52] Historical capital of Bagratuni Armenia. Turkish: "Memory"[53] Sevaverag Siverek Armenian: "Black ruins" Chabakchur (Çabakçur) Bingöl Armenian: "rough waters". Turkish: "Thousand lakes". Çabakçur was used until 1944. Kurds refer to the city as Çolig. Metskert Mazgirt Armenian: "Big city" Pertak Pertek Armenian: "Small castle" Assyrian[edit] Most Assyrian name changes occurred in the southeast of Turkey near the Syrian border in the Tur Abdin region. The Tur Abdin (Syriac: ???? ????????) is a hilly region incorporating the eastern half of Mardin Province, and ??rnak Province west of the Tigris, on the border with Syria. The name 'Tur Abdin' is from the Syriac language meaning 'mountain of the servants (of God)'. Tur Abdin is of great importance to Syriac Orthodox Christians, for whom the region used to be a monastic and cultural heartland. The Assyrian/Syriac people[54][55] of Tur Abdin call themselves Suroye and Suryoye, and traditionally speak an Eastern Aramaic dialect called Turoyo.[56] After the Assyrian genocide, the Assyrians of the region were either depopulated or massacred. Currently, there are 5, 000 Assyrians living in the region.[57] Ni?anyan estimates that 400 Assyrian geographical locations have been changed.[5] Map showing native names of Assyrian villages in the Tur Abdin region Notable name changes of Assyrian geographical locations:[44][45] Assyrian name Named changed to: Notes Kafrô Taxtaytô Elbe?endi Eastern Aramaic: "Lower Village"[58] Barsomik Tütenocak Named after Nestorian Patriarch Bar Sawma Merdô Mardin Eastern Aramaic: "Fortresses"[59][60] Iwardo Gülgöze Eastern Aramaric: "Fountain of flowers" Arbo Ta?köy Eastern Aramaic: "Goat" Qartmîn Yayvantepe Eastern Aramaic: "Middle village" Kfargawsô Gercü? Eastern Aramaic: "Sheltered village" Kefshenne Kayal? Eastern Aramaic: "Stone of peace" Be? Zabday ?dil Named after Babai the Great who founded a monastery and school in the region. Xisna d'Kêpha (Hisno d'Kifo) Hasankeyf Eastern Aramaic: "Rock fortress" Zaz ?zb?rak An?el Yemi?li Greek[edit] Many of the Greek names have maintained their origins from the Byzantine empire and Empire of Trebizond era. With the establishment of the Ottoman empire, many Turkish name changes have continued to retain their Greek origins. For example, the modern name "?zmir" derives from the former Greek name ?????? "Smyrna", through the first two syllables of the phrase "??? ???????" (pronounced "is Smirnin"), which means "to Smyrna" in Greek. A similar etymology also applies to other Turkish cities with former Greek names, such as ?znik (from the phrase "is Nikaean", meaning "to Nicaea"), or even for the Greek island of Kos, called "?stanköy" in Turkish.[44] Ni?anyan estimates that 4,200 Greek geographical locations have been changed, the most of any ethnic minority.[5] Greek geographical names renamed in Turkey Notable name changes of Greek geographical locations:[44][45] Greek name Named changed to: Notes Potamia Güneysu Greek: "River". On August 12, 2009, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo?an used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.[30] Néa Phôkaia Yenifoça Hadrianoupolis Edirne Greek: "City of Hadrian". Founded by Emperor Hadrian in about 123 A.D. Became temporary Ottoman capital after Ottoman conquest in 1363.[61] Kalipolis Gelibolu Greek: "Beautiful city". The city was founded in the 5th century B.C.[62] Makri Fethiye Greek: "long". Following the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the Greeks of Makri were sent to Greece where they founded the town of Nea Makri (New Makri).[63] Kalamaki Kalkan Until the early 1920s, the majority of its inhabitants were Greeks. They left in 1923 because of the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey after the Greco-Turkish War and emigrated to Attica, where they founded the town of Kalamaki.[64] Konstantinoupolis Istanbul Greek: "City of Constantine". Founded by Emperor Constantine in 330 A.D. The name Istanbul has been in use since even before the 1453 Ottoman conquest. Different names of the city coexisted during the Ottoman times, until all names other than Istanbul became completely obsolete towards the late empire.[65] Neopolis Ku?adas? It was known as Neopolis (New city) during the Byzantine era and later as Scala Nova or Scala Nuova under the Genovese and Venetians.[66] Nikaia ?znik Named after the wife of Lysimachus. The Nicene Creed was named after the First Council of Nicaea, which met in the city in 325 A.D. Nikoumedeia ?zmit Named after Nicomedes I of Bithynia, who re-founded the city in 264 B.C. Sinasos Mustafapa?a In 1924, during the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, the Greeks of the town left to Greece and founded Nea Sinasos, a town in the northern part of the island of Euboea. Smyrna ?zmir Ancient Greek city located at a central and strategic point on the Aegean coast of Anatolia. Greeks left the city after the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922 to Greece The Prince Islands Proti Prinkipo Antigoni Halki Prens Adalar? K?nal?ada Büyükada Burgazada Heybeliada During the Byzantine period, princes and other royalty were exiled on the islands, and later members of the Ottoman sultan's family were exiled there as well, giving the islands their present name. Kurdish and Zazaki[edit] The Kurdish and Zaza geographical name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire due to the Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish and Zaza geographical name changes became more common.[8] During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised the presence of the Kurds and Zazas statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks.[67][68] This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980.[69] Also included in the category of Kurdish geographical name changes are Zazaki, which is actually not among Kurdish. Ni?anyan estimates that 4,000 Kurdish and Zaza geographical locations have been changed.[5] Kurdish geographical names renamed in Turkey Notable name changes of Kurdish geographical locations:[44][45][70] Kurdish and Zazaki name Named changed to: Notes Qilaban Uludere Kurdish: "Castellan" Dersîm Tunceli province In September 2012, legislation was promulgated to restore the name of the province of Tunceli to Dersim.[32] Qoser K?z?ltepe Kurdish: "Red mountain" ?ax Çatak Kurdish: "Tree branch" or "Mountain" Êlih Batman Karaz Kocaköy Pîran Dicle Zazaki and Krd.: "Wise men" Hênî Hani Hênî: Zaz. Spring Dara Hênî Genç Dar: Tree, Hênî: Spring Ginc (Genc) Kaleköy, Solhan Inhabited by Zazas. The name comes from Middle Persian ??? "genc", which means treasure. This city should not be confused with the modern day city of Genç. Genc was the center of Bingöl Province between 1924-1927. In 1936 the city was moved to Dara Hênî where the Dara Hênî's name was ultimately changed to Genç. Çolig Bingöl The meaning of the name is interpreted as somewhere that is in a deep valley. ?emrex Maz?da?? Kurdish: "Road to Damascus (?am)" Norgeh Pazaryolu Kurdish: "Place of light" Amed Diyarbak?r Armenians also refer to the city as Dikranagerd (Armenian: built by King Tigran). Colemêrg Hakkari Hakkari was known as Çölemerik in accordance with government records in 1928. Armenians refer to the city as Gghmar which was noted in Tovma Artsruni's History of the House of Artsrunik written in the 10th century. Serêkaniyê Ceylanp?nar Kurdish: "Head of spring (a natural fountain)" Riha ?anl?urfa The city was referred to as Edessa in a 4th-century Greek text. It was also referred to as El-Ruha in a 7th-century Arabic text. The city was changed to Urfa.
