According to the authors, "Censors repeatedly targeted Wikipedia pages about government rivals, minority religious beliefs, and criticisms of the state, officials, and the police. Just under half of the blocked Wiki-pages are biographies, including pages about individuals the authorities have allegedly detained or killed."[7] Anderson said that Persian Wikipedia, as a microcosm of the Iranian internet, is a "useful place to uncover the types of online content forbidden and an excellent template to identify keyword blocking themes and filtering rules that apply across the greater internet."[8] On 2 March 2020, during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran, Persian Wikipedia appears to be disrupted in Iran after the death of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, whom is a close confidant to the country's supreme leader Ali Khamenei.[9] Gallery[edit] Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2015) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2016) Persian Wikipedia's 500,000 article logo (27 July 2016) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2017) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2018) Persian Wikipedia's Nowruz logo (21 March 2019) Topics[edit] In 2019 the Persian Wikipedia has 500 thousand unique categories.
