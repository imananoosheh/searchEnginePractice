Yasseri's research has been widely covered in mainstream media and social media.[4][5][6][7][8][9] Contents 1 Education 2 Research and career 2.1 Wikipedia 2.2 Social media and politics 2.3 TEDx 3 References Education[edit] Yasseri was educated at Sharif University of Technology[1] and the University of Göttingen where he was awarded a PhD in physics for research supervised by Reiner Kree [Wikidata].[10] Research and career[edit] Yasseri's research investigates complex systems, computational social science,[11] network science,[12] social data science and human dynamics.[3][13][14] Wikipedia[edit] Yasseri has studied the statistical trends of systemic bias at Wikipedia introduced by editing conflicts and their resolution.[15] His research examined the counterproductive work behavior of edit warring. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive behavior at Wikipedia and relied instead on the statistical measurement of detecting "reverting/reverted pairs" or "mutually reverting edit pairs". Such a "mutually reverting edit pair" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the "mutually reverting edit pairs". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, Anarchism and Muhammad. By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[16] In a study published by PLoS ONE in 2012 he estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the simple English Wikipedia.[17] The Wikimedia Foundation hopes to increase the number of editors in the Global South to 37% by 2015.[citation needed] Social media and politics[edit] Yasseri has studied the role of social media in politics. He has used Wikipedia page view statistics and Google search volumes to understand and potentially predict electoral popularity in different countries.[18] He has co-written Political Turbulence; How Social Media Shape Collective Action[19][20] which was selected among the best politics books of 2016 by The Guardian[21] and was awarded the Political Studies Association book of the year award.[22] TEDx[edit] Yasseri is a TEDx Thessaloniki 2019 speaker.
