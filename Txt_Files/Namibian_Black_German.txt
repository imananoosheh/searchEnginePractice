Namibian Black German - Wikipedia Namibian Black German From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Namibian Black German Küchendeutsch Native to Namibia Native speakers None Language family German-based pidgin Language codes ISO 639-3 None (mis) Glottolog None Namibian Black German, also NBG, (German: Küchendeutsch, "kitchen German") is a pidgin language of Namibia that derives from standard German.[1] It is nearly extinct.[citation needed] It was spoken mostly by Namibians who did not learn standard German during the period of German rule. It was never a first language. It is currently spoken as a second language by people over 50 years old,[when?] who today usually also speak German, Afrikaans, or English.[citation needed] Contents 1 History 2 Prepositions 3 Examples 4 References 5 Further reading History[edit] Colonial acquisition of German in Namibia often took place outside of formal education and was primarily self-taught. Like many pidgin languages, Namibian Black German developed through limited access to the standard language and was restricted to the work environment. Currently several hundred thousand Namibians speak German as a second language, and while Namibian German often does not adhere to standard German, it is not pidgin.[citation needed] Prepositions[edit] English and Afrikaans have left an influence on the development of NBG, leading to three primary prepositional patterns:[citation needed] adding a preposition where Standard German would use the accusative dropping prepositions which are usually present in Standard German changing the preposition that is required by the verb Examples[edit] Examples of phrases with Standard German equivalents: Lange nicht sehen - long no see ("Lange nicht gesehen") Was Banane kosten? - How much does the banana cost? ("Was kostet die/eine Banane?") spät Uhr - 'late hour', meaning 'it's late' ("es ist spät") Herr fahren Jagd, nicht Haus - "Master went hunting and he's not at home" ("Der Herr ist zur Jagd gefahren und ist nicht zu Hause") References[edit] ^ Deumert, Ama (2003).
