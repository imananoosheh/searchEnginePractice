WikiNodes - Wikipedia WikiNodes From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search IPad app for browsing Wikipedia Not to be confused with WikiNode. WikiNodes is an app for the Apple iPad built by IDEA.org.[1] WikiNodes was the first tablet app for browsing Wikipedia using a radial tree approach to visualize how articles and subsections of articles are interrelated. The app displays related items (articles or sections of an article), which spread on the screen, as a spiderweb of icons.[2] Contents 1 Operation 2 Reception 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Operation[edit] The app uses the SpicyNodes visualization technique which was awarded a "best for teaching and learning" award in 2011 from American Association of School Librarians (AASL),[3] and voted #edchat's 35 Best Web 2.0 Classroom Tools in 2010.[4] The user interface is based on two display modes: Page view – displays Wikipedia articles in long form, similar to how they appear on the main Wikipedia web site.[5] Node view – divides Wikipedia articles into sections, and links articles to related articles, similar to mind mapping.[6] The user can drag nodes, taps any node to display it in detail, with a panel to scroll to read the contents of the section.[7] This provides a visual way to see the relationships between articles.[8][9] As of June 2011, the app supports the 36 top Wikipedia languages (by number of articles). Reception[edit] The app was highlighted as a "Staff pick" by Apple's U.S. App Store, Week of May 28, 2011; as "New and Noteworthy" by Apple's U.S. App Store, Week of May 5, 2011; and at other times by Apple's app stores for non-US countries.[10] It has been favorably covered by several bloggers, including those in the references below.[11] See also[edit] List of Wikipedia mobile applications – Other iOS mobile apps providing access to Wikipedia Radial tree – the general type of layout algorithm SpicyNodes – Information visualization technique References[edit] ^ Wikipedia's 'The Signpost' 13 June 2011, In the news. ^ Mossberg, Walt.
