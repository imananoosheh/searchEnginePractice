In 1225 Zliwitz was granted staple rights by Henry the Bearded. The Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg had purchased the Lubusz Land from the Silesian Duke Boles?aw II the Bald in 1249. Between 1373 and 1415 it was part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (or the Czech Lands), ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. Pre-Schengen passport stamp S?ubice is closely linked to its German sister city Frankfurt (Oder), of which it was a part until 1945. The two cities have been forced apart by the drawing of the Oder-Neisse line, by which Germans have been expropriated and expelled from the lands east of the Oder and Neisse. The two cities share many urban amenities and collaborate on various projects, such as a wastewater treatment plant in S?ubice that serves both towns, as well as the Collegium Polonicum [pl] extension of some of the Viadrina European University's departments on the Polish side of the border. Furthermore, S?ubice is part of a special S?ubice-Kostrzyn Economic Zone.
