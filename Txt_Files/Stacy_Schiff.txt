She was a senior editor at Simon & Schuster until 1990. Her essays and articles have appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The New York Review of Books, The Times Literary Supplement, and The Washington Post.[3][4][5] Schiff won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for Vera, a biography of Vera Nabokov, wife and muse of Vladimir Nabokov. She was also a finalist for the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for Saint-Exupéry: A Biography of Antoine de Saint Exupéry.[1] Schiff's A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America (2005) won the George Washington Book Prize.[6] Her fourth book, Cleopatra: A Life, was published in 2010. As the Wall Street Journal's reviewer put it, "Schiff does a rare thing: She gives us a book we'd miss if it didn't exist." [7] The New Yorker termed the book "a work of literature;"[8] Simon Winchester predicted "it will become a classic."[9] Cleopatra appeared on the The New York Times's Top Ten Books of 2010,[10] and won the 2011 PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for biography.[11] Little, Brown published The Witches: Salem, 1692 in 2015.
