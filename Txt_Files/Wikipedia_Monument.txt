An Ethnography of Wikipedia, delivered an opening ceremony address.[8] Inscription[edit] With this monument the citizens of S?ubice would like to pay homage to thousands of anonymous editors all over the world, who have contributed voluntarily to the creation of Wikipedia, the greatest project co-created by people regardless of political, religious or cultural borders. In the year this monument is unveiled Wikipedia is available in more than 280 languages and contains about 30 million articles. The benefactors behind this monument feel certain that with Wikipedia as one of its pillars the knowledge society will be able to contribute to the sustainable development of our civilization, social justice and peace among nations.[9] Symposium in the Collegium Polonicum Unveiling of the Wikipedia Monument Play media Video of the unveiling Representatives and persons responsible at the unveiling The model for the sculpture Visible destruction on the fingers of the monument, condition September 2019 Statement from Jimmy Wales[edit] When Wikipedia started back in 2001 I have to say that I never imagined a day when Wikipedia would be honored with a monument – we write about them, we photograph them with our Wiki Loves Monuments competition, and now we have a monument of our own. It is a truly special and exciting day, and one that I hope shines the spotlight on the thousands of Wikimedians who edit Wikipedia and make it the source of free knowledge it has come to be. I look forward to visiting S?ubice one day to see the monument for myself and perhaps meeting some of those involved in the project.[10] —?Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, on the occasion of the unveiling References[edit] ^ a b c d e "Poland to Honor Wikipedia With Monument".
