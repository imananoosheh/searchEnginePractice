Titles are also published in French and German respectively under the names "Livres Groupe" and "Bücher Gruppe".[6][7][8] Books' publications do not include the images from the original Web documents but, in their place, URLs pointing to the Web images. According to the FAQ page: “We understand how annoying that can be for the reader. But our first priority has to be respecting copyright laws. In addition, the resolution of the online photos are not high enough to print in a book.”[9] In 2009, Books LLC and its sister imprint General Books LLC produced 224,460 and 11,887 titles respectively.[10][11] Imprint and book club names[edit] In brackets: kind of material published and sold.
