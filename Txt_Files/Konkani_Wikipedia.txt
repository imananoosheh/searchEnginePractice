Earlier in September 2013, 4 volumes of Konkani vishwakosh (encyclopedia) were relicensed under Creative Commons Licenses.[2] Information from these volumes of encyclopedias were used to write articles on Konkani Wikipedia.[3] In the same year a Wikipedia-related workshop was organized at Goa University.[4] In April 2014, two introductory sessions on editing Wikipedia were conducted at Roshni Nilaya School of Social Work in Goa.[5] In July 2015 the Wikipedia went live after incubation for 9 years. At the time of the official inauguration the Wikipedia contained 2500 articles. The project was supported by Goa University and Nirmala Institute of Education. Late Madhavi Sardesai, then a professor and Head of Department of Konkani at the Goa University, played an important role to launch the project. Prakash Parienkar, the current head of department of Konkani department of Goa University had said at that time:[6] We will assign projects to our students and writers too, to write articles on different subjects related to Goa and upload them on the Wikipedia. This will include information on local food, its culture, tradition, tourist spots and much more. In January 2016, a one-day edit-a-thon was organized at Krishnadas Shama Central Library, Goa. Rahmanuddin Shaik, a Center for Internet and Society representative trained the participants about Wikipedia editing and policies. Almost 100 articles were created during this one-day event.[7] See also[edit] Marathi Wikipedia Tulu Wikipedia References[edit] ^ "Konkani Wikipedia goes live". The Times of India.
