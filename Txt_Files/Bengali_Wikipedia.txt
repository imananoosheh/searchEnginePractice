Along with other Wikipedia sub-domains, Bengali language sub-domain was created at that time.[7] A placeholder page was created automatically in that sub-domain on June 1, 2002.[8] On December 9, 2003, A Bangladeshi Ph.D. student of Canada's McGill University named Shah Asaduzzaman emailed Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales with a request to create Bengali Wikipedia.[9][10] As a result, the developers created a test page on the Wikipedia named "Home Page" on December 26 of the same year.[10] The Main Page of Bengali Wikipedia was created on January 27, 2004 from an IP address which marks the official beginning of Bengali Wikipedia. '????? ????' ("B?ngl? Bh?sh?"; Bengali Language in English) is the first article of Bengali Wikipedia which was created on May 24, 2004. History[edit] Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales with Bengali Wikipedians during Bengali Wikipedia's 10th anniversary celebration in Dhaka (2015). Bengali Wikipedia started its journey in January 27, 2004.[11][12] Back then, the people of Bangladesh had a little interest in Wikipedia. A few students and scholars used the English Wikipedia, but it was not accountable. Besides that, there were various difficulties contributing in Bengali. The whole scenario has been changed in 2006.[13] During that time, the Bengali blogging world was growing slowly, and many people became accustomed to Bengali computing where a free and open-source Bengali typing tool, Avro Keyboard played a key role. On March 25, 2006, a Wiki team was created by the ‘Bangladesh Open Source Network’ (BdOSN) to popularize Wikipedia throughout the country.[13] The aim was to represent the country to the world through Wikipedia and build a complete encyclopedia in Bengali. At that time, Bengali Wikipedia had only 500 articles. ‘BdOSN wiki team’ managed to spread the word through some newspapers and start a Bengali Wiki mailing list. Soon, many Bengali-speaking people from Bangladesh and abroad joined them in this dynamic project. As a result, by the end of the October, Bengali Wikipedia got to 10,000 articles.[13] Among the South Asian language Wikipedias, Bengali Wikipedia reached that milestone first, and many of these articles were illustrated with photos from the demonstrator of Bengali Language Movement Dr. Rafiqul Islam, who donated all his historical photographs taken during the language movement to Wikimedia Commons.[13] Number of Wikipedia articles[14] One of the pioneer of the Bengali Wikipedia, Dr. Ragib Hasan said that “The biggest challenge was writing something on internet in Bengali. The Bengali Unicode was not supported on most operating systems, only few websites on the internet supported Bengali Unicode, and users had difficulties configuring it. Moreover, the idea of writing something with Bengali Unicode was new. … in the beginning, the idea of a Wikipedia in Bengali was not actually workable.”[13] Between 2009 and 2010, Bengali speakers from West Bengal, India also started to contribute to Bengali Wikipedia.[13] In the meantime, the Wikimedia Foundation started their operations and in October 3, 2011 a local chapter named Wikimedia Bangladesh was approved in Bangladesh[11] by the Foundation to promote educational content in Bengali. On February 26, 2015, Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia—visited Bangladesh for a celebration program that was organized by Wikimedia Bangladesh[15][16][17] to mark the tenth year of Bengali Wikipedia.[16][17][18][19][20][21] In his keynote, Jimmy said that according to the article depth, Bengali Wikipedia is rated quite well.[16][22] Bengali Wikipedia now has 77,680 articles on various topics with 1,249 active editors per month. As of January 2019, Bengali Wikipedia is the only online free encyclopedia written in Bengali language.[4][23] It is also one of the largest Bengali content related sites on the internet.[24] Users and editors[edit] Bengali Wikipedia statistics Number of user accounts Number of articles Number of files Number of administrators 256721 77680 7003 12 Confusion[edit] Over the years, there have been confusion in Bangladeshi media regarding some information of Bengali Wikipedia. In April 2018, Bangladeshi print and electronic media reported that Wikipedia named Runa Laila, a renowned singer from Bangladesh, among its Top 30 Bengali people of all time.[25][26][27][28] This confusion arises due to the use of a collage image in the Bengalis article's infobox at Bengali and English version of Wikipedia.[29] In August of the same year, an unregistered user added fake date of death in Muhammed Zafar Iqbal's article, which also attracted media attention.[30][31][32][33] Gallery[edit] Bengali Wikipedia's 14th Anniversary group photo, Dhaka (2018) Bengali Wikipedia's 13th Anniversary group photo, Dhaka (2017) Bengali Wikipedia's 10th Anniversary group photo, Kolkata (2015) See also[edit] History of Wikipedia Reliability of Wikipedia Wikipedia community References[edit] ^ Noronha, Frederick (30 September 2006).
