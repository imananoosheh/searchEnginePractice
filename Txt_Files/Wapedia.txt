Wapedia - Wikipedia Wapedia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wapedia front page as displayed on a Nokia cellphone Wapedia was a mobile version of Wikipedia. It was started in August 2004 by Florian Amrhein and shut down on 4 November 2013.[1] It was operated by Taptu.[2] Wapedia was originally a Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) site for use on mobile phones of the very early 2000s. The URL for Wapedia was http://wapedia.mobi/ (which was one of the early examples of a .mobi website).[3] Over time, HTML interfaces were added, with the site generating pages optimised for a variety of mobile devices such as smart phones, Personal digital assistantss (PDAs), and tablets. In 2009 dedicated applications for iPhone,[4] Android and WebOS were launched. Wapedia served articles using a combination of a proxy-like behavior and a local article database. It did not offer the ability to edit pages. Wapedia injected adverts into the Wikipedia articles, either in the HTML or in the applications.
