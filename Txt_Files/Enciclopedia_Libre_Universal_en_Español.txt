Contents 1 History 2 Post-split history 3 Statistics 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] The Enciclopedia Libre was founded by contributors to the Spanish-language Wikipedia who decided to start an independent project. Led by Edgar Enyedy, they left Wikipedia on 26 February 2002, and created the new website, provided by the University of Seville for free, with the freely licensed articles of the Spanish-language Wikipedia.[2] The reasons for the split are explained on Enciclopedia Libre.[3] Key issues included concerns about censorship and the possibility of advertising on Wikipedia.[4] From the interview with Edgar Enyedy,[5] the main reasons for splitting at that time were: Perceived expectation that Wikipedia would soon start hosting advertisements.[5] Non-English Wikipedias were running older, less featured versions of MediaWiki. When national groups offered help in software development and maintenance, access to the servers was denied. The downloadable database dumps of Wikipedia content were highly outdated. Wikipedia was hosted on a .com rather than a .org domain. Post-split history[edit] In 2011, Enyedy said that the sole reason for the failure of Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Español as a long term project was because it "was not intended to last. It was merely a form of pressure. Some of the goals were achieved, not all of them, but it was worth the cost."[6] In 2011, Enyedy said "Nowadays, the romantic point of view is that EL survived and is still going strong."[6] He argued that while the viewpoint is positive, it is not factual.[6] Statistics[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

Since then, the Spanish Wikipedia has grown at a much greater rate. As of December 2016, the Spanish Wikipedia hosts approximately twenty-six times as many articles as Enciclopedia Libre. Historical article counts. The Spanish Wikipedia is shown in red; Enciclopedia Libre is blue.
