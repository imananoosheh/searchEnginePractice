Bibcode - Wikipedia Bibcode From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For the Wikipedia template to link to bibcoded articles, see Template:bibcode Code used to identify references in certain astronomical data systems Bibcode Full name Bibliographic code Introduced 1990s No. of digits 19 Check digit none Example 1924MNRAS..84..308E The bibcode (also known as the refcode) is a compact identifier used by several astronomical data systems to uniquely specify literature references. Contents 1 Adoption 2 Format 3 Examples 4 See also 5 References Adoption[edit] The Bibliographic Reference Code (refcode) was originally developed to be used in SIMBAD and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely, for example, by the NASA Astrophysics Data System who coined and prefer the term "bibcode".[1][2] Format[edit] The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA where YYYY is the four-digit year of the reference and JJJJJ is a code indicating where the reference was published. In the case of a journal reference, VVVV is the volume number, M indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g., L for a letters section), PPPP gives the starting page number, and A is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods (.) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number.[1][2] Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the M column. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a, etc.) and inserted into column M. The remaining four digits are used in the page field.[2] Examples[edit] Some examples of bibcodes are: Bibcode Reference 1974AJ.....79..819H Heintz, W. D. (1974).
